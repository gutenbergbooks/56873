<div class="chapter"><h2>PREFACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief aim of this informal “handbook for parents”
is to review and unify, in non-technical language,
the findings of modern psychology which
bear especially on the laws of mental and moral
growth. The time has come when it is not only
desirable but necessary to attempt something of this
sort; for in the course of their labours the educational,
medical, and social psychologists have accumulated
a mass of data revealing unsuspected
defects, and hinting at marvellous possibilities, in
the upbringing of the young.</p>

<p>On the one hand, they have shown that not enough
heed has been paid to the hampering influences of
an unfavourable environment and physical maladjustment;
and, on the other hand, they have made it
clear that, by instituting certain reforms, it is entirely
feasible to develop mental and moral vigour in
the mass of mankind to an astonishing degree. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>own belief, indeed, for reasons set forth in subsequent
pages, is that the discoveries of the modern psychologists
justify the assertion that, through proper
training in childhood, it is possible to create a race
of men and women far superior morally to the generalty
of the world’s inhabitants to-day, and manifesting
intellectual powers of a far higher order than
the generalty now display.</p>

<p>Whether this belief will ever be vindicated—whether,
for the matter of that, the discoveries of
recent psychological research will prove of any real
value—depends, of course, on the extent to which
practical application is made by those having charge
of the young, and particularly by parents. For the
fact most surely established by the scientific investigators
is that it is in the first years of life, and in
the influences of the home, that the forces are set in
motion which count for most in the making or marring
of the individual’s character and career. Parental
responsibility is consequently much greater
than most parents suppose; but so is parental opportunity.
This book accordingly is addressed primarily
to parents in the hope that it may be of some
assistance to them in avoiding the pitfalls, and
developing the possibilities, of that most important
of all human activities—the training of the next
generation.</p>

<p>Portions of the book have already appeared in
various periodicals—<cite>The Century Magazine</cite>, <cite>The
Outlook</cite>, <cite>McClure’s Magazine</cite>, etc.—and to the editors
of these publications I owe a word of grateful
acknowledgment. I am also under obligations to
numerous medical and psychological friends for valuable
information. But most of all, as always, I
am indebted to my wife, whose critical reading of the
manuscript has resulted in many helpful suggestions.</p>

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>any years ago, according to a story
which remains vividly in my memory
by reason of its grim suggestiveness,
two small boys were one day sauntering along a
country road. The sight of an orchard, resplendent
in its autumn glory of red and green and gold,
tempted them with irresistible appeal, as it has
tempted thousands of other boys before and since.
Over the rail-fence they scrambled, up a well-laden
tree they climbed, and soon were merrily at work
filling their pockets.</p>

<p>But now from a near-by cottage came the man
who owned the orchard, and his coming was the signal
for a hasty descent. One of the boys made good
his escape; the other, less quick-footed, was dragged,
a loudly-protesting captive, to the home of the local
magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>“More apple-stealing!” this stern functionary
exclaimed. “Something must be done to stop it.
Let us make an example of this bad boy.” To prison
forthwith he consigned the luckless youth.</p>

<p>His companion, thankful for his happier fate, returned
to his home, his school, and his books. From
school he went to college, and afterward took up the
study of law, beginning his professional career with
a reputation for great intellectual ability and
strength of character. In course of time he was
made a judge.</p>

<p>As judge he was called on to preside at the trial
of a man accused of murder. The evidence of guilt
was conclusive, conviction speedy. It became his
duty to don the black cap and pronounce sentence
of death. But before he did this, he was struck with
something familiar in the prisoner’s sodden, passion-marked
features, made inquiry concerning his early
history, and, to his mingled horror and amazement,
learned that the wretched man was none other than
the happy, buoyant lad who had first felt the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
hand of the law on account of the orchard-robbing
episode in which the judge, now about to doom him
to the scaffold, had gone scot-free.</p>

<p>Than this strange chapter in human experience
I can at the moment recall nothing that more strikingly
suggests and illustrates the dominant theory
in modern scientific thought regarding the offender
against society. The implication that the contrasting
careers of the two boys were largely determined
by circumstances over which they had no control,
and that it was the brutalising jail experience of
the one and the more fortunate upbringing of the
other that chiefly accounted for their diverse
fates, unquestionably represents the views held by
the great majority of present-day students of delinquency
and crime. To be sure, there are not a few
who would raise the question, “Might not the boy
who was caught in the orchard have ‘gone wrong’
in any event, because of inborn defects?” These
are the enthusiasts conspicuous to-day as leaders of
the so-called eugenics movement looking to the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>provement
of mankind on stock-breeding principles—by
sterilisation of the “unfit,” stricter marriage
laws, etc. Nor can it be denied that they have on
their side a formidable array of facts which would
seem to demonstrate the unescapable fatality of a
bad heredity. On the other hand it is equally certain
that there is a steadily growing body of evidence
giving ever greater support to the opposite view—to
the view, namely, that after all the influence of
heredity is of quite secondary importance to that of
environment in the marring or making of a human
life.</p>

<p>Even the facts emphasised by the eugenists themselves
sometimes tend, on close examination, to bear
out the belief that it is in the surroundings and training
of a child rather than in his heredity that the
sources of his ultimate goodness or badness are
mainly to be found. The history of the notorious
Juke family, featured by almost every modern advocate
of the “fatal heredity” theory, is a case in
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The first Jukes of whom anything is known were
five sisters of obscure parentage who lived in Ulster
County, New York, in the second half of the eighteenth
century. At least four of the five took early
to a life of vice, and eventually all married and had
children. Many years afterward a visitor to an
Ulster County jail noticed that among its inmates,
awaiting trial on various charges, were six members
of one family, including two boys accused of assault
with intent to kill. Inquiry showed that the six
were directly descended from the oldest Juke girl,
and that more than half of their male blood-relatives
in the county were likewise in some degree criminal.</p>

<p>Impressed by these facts the jail visitor, Mr. R.
L. Dugdale, determined to make a genealogical research
into the life histories of as many of the descendants
of the five Juke sisters as could be traced.
Altogether it was found possible to obtain pretty
complete data concerning seven hundred and nine of
these, with the following astonishing results:</p>

<p>Of the entire seven hundred and nine, not twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
had been skilled workers, and ten of these had learned
their trade in prison; only twenty-two had been
persons of property, and of this number eight had
lost the little they acquired; sixty-four had been in
the county alms-house; one hundred and forty-two
had received outdoor relief; one hundred and twenty-eight
had been prostitutes, and eighteen keepers of
houses of ill-fame; finally, seventy-six were reported
as criminals, with one hundred and fifteen
more or less serious crimes to their discredit. All
this in seven generations of a single family.</p>

<p>Surely one might well be tempted to find here “the
most striking proof of the heredity of crime,” as
Cesare Lombroso did not hesitate to pronounce this
sad history of the Jukes. But there is something to
be added.</p>

<p>Following the publication of Mr. Dugdale’s book,
“The Jukes,” giving the family record, there came
under the care of a charitable organisation an
eighth-generation descendant of the oldest Juke sister,
a foundling baby boy, cast upon the tender mer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>cies
of the world with all the burden of “innate
depravity” transmitted from his vicious ancestors.
Instead of taking it for granted that he would inevitably
come to an evil end, the charity-workers
decided to give him the benefit of a refined environment
and good family care. Accordingly a home
was found for him with a kind-hearted widow, whose
own sons had grown to a worthy manhood, and from
her for ten years he received the loving and intelligent
training which is the birthright of every child.</p>

<p>At the end of that time he had developed into a
fine, manly boy, with, however, a somewhat superabundant
fund of animal spirits and a tendency to
unruliness. It was evident that, owing to her advanced
age, his foster-mother could not give him
the stricter discipline he now seemed to need, and
arrangements were made for his adoption by a
farmer and his wife living in a Western State. By
them he was again treated with the utmost affection,
coupled with more firmness than he had hitherto
known. Little by little his unruliness disappeared;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
he became eager to excel both at school and in the
work of the farm, and soon became known as one of
the best boys of the neighbourhood. The older he
grew the more evidence he gave of possessing a
strong moral foundation on which to build his future
career. When last heard from by the charitable
organisation to which he owed so much, he had
struck out for himself, an alert, vigorous, forceful
young man, of sterling character, and full of the
self-confidence which wins success.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Dugdale himself, in the course of
his exhaustive account of the evil ways of the Jukes,
calls attention to the case of a fifth-generation descendant,
the daughter of a brothel-keeper, and having
two sisters who eventually became prostitutes.
Nor did it seem at all likely that she would turn
out any better than they; for, before she was fifteen,
she had been arrested and imprisoned for vagrancy.
But, as good fortune would have it, shortly after her
release from jail she met, fell in love with, and married
a young German, a cement-burner of steady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
industrious habits. Taken by him out of her former
debasing environment, given a good home and the
example of a strong character, she grew to a reputable
womanhood, respected and admired by all who
knew her.</p>

<p>Many similar instances of the saving power of
good surroundings might be cited. “One of the most
useful men I know of to-day,” testifies Mr. Ernest
K. Coulter, formerly clerk of the New York Children’s
Court, “saw his father murder his mother in
cold blood. There was a bad record on her side of
the house, too. But a good man saw something in
that boy while he was being detained as a witness
against his father. As a result of that man’s interest,
that boy to-day is serving his fellow-men and his
country in a most important field.”</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania an eight-year-old orphan girl of
poor parentage, drudge in a city boarding-house,
with no companionship except that of ignorant servants,
was heralded in the newspapers as a “prodigy
of crime” because she had been caught setting fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to a house. When asked in court why she had done
this, she made the frank reply, “To see the fire burn
and the engines run.” There being at that time no
probation system in Pennsylvania, she was promptly
sentenced to the House of Refuge, where, like the boy
sent to jail for stealing apples, she would be sure
to come under the influence of vile associates.</p>

<p>But, more fortunate than the boy of the orchard,
this child had an unknown friend at court, Mrs.
Hannah K. Schoff, who interceded with the judge
and gained his permission to place the little incendiarist
in a good home instead of the House of
Refuge. Five years afterward, reporting to the
International Prison Commission the result of her
experiment, Mrs. Schoff was able to declare that this
dangerous juvenile criminal had developed into “as
sweet, attractive, and good a child as can be found
anywhere.”</p>

<p>An Italian Camorrist had two sons. The
younger, at the age of three, was separated from his
father, taken to a distant city, and given a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
education. Like the Juke child of the eighth generation
he grew to be an exemplary young man. His
brother, who remained with the father, became, like
him, a man of vice and crime, hated, feared, and despised.</p>

<p>But far more impressive than isolated instances
like these are the data now available regarding the
outcome of similar experimentation on a large scale.
Four years ago the Children’s Aid Society of New
York—the organisation which took the Juke foundling
under its wing—published a report detailing
the results of its “placing out” system for a period
of more than half a century. The officials of this
society have always been imbued with the idea that
every child, no matter how bad his heredity, is entitled
to the benefit of a good home upbringing, and
in accordance with this idea they have, during the
period covered by the report, placed twenty-eight
thousand children in carefully selected homes, besides
finding situations in the country for about three
times as many older boys and girls. Most of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
wards have been slum children, having back of them
a family history of crime, vice, insanity, or pauperism.
Nevertheless, the society’s officials inform us:</p>

<p>“A careful investigation of the records gives the
following results: 87 per cent. have done well, 8 per
cent. were returned to New York, 2 per cent. died,
one quarter of 1 per cent. committed petty crimes
and were arrested, and 2¼ per cent. left their homes
and disappeared. These last were larger boys of
restless disposition, unaccustomed to country life or
any sort of restraint. Some of them struck out for
themselves, obtaining work at higher wages, and were
temporarily lost sight of, but years afterward we
hear of them as having grown up good and respected
citizens.... The younger children placed out by
the society always show a very large average of success.
The great proportion have grown up respectable
men and women, creditable members of society.
Many of them have been legally adopted by their
foster-parents. The majority have become successful
farmers or farmers’ wives, mechanics, and busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>ness
men. Many have acquired property, and no
inconsiderable number of them have attained positions
of honour and trust.”</p>

<p>One of the children thus developed was a typical
waif of the slums, a ragged urchin loitering in the
streets of New York, and sleeping in store-entrances
and hall-ways, until one day taken in charge by a
kindly policeman. Investigation disclosed that he
was a homeless orphan, and until some definite provision
could be made for his upbringing he was committed
to the city institution on Randall’s Island.
Thence, after a few months, he was transferred to
the care of the Children’s Aid Society, which undertook
to find a home for him.</p>

<p>In midsummer of 1859, accordingly, he was sent
to Indiana with a party of other homeless lads, and
was placed with Mr. E. E. Hall, a Noblesville
farmer. Two years later, to the mingled grief and
pride of his foster-parents, and when not yet fifteen
years old, he enlisted in the service of his country,
entering the army as a drummer-boy. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
war he went back to the Indiana farm, and, employing
his leisure moments to good advantage, prepared
for college. In the seventies, equipped with a good
education and a well-disciplined mind, he moved farther
West. He finally settled in North Dakota,
where, after engaging successfully in various enterprises,
he became, in 1881, the cashier of a bank.</p>

<p>His thoughts now turned to politics, into which
he plunged with great vigour, and with every prospect
of success, as he had in the meantime won for
himself a commanding position as one of the most
popular and trusted men in his community. In 1884
he ran for the post of county treasurer, won his election,
and, adding to his reputation by the way he
conducted this office, held it continuously for six
years. Then higher honours were thrust upon him;
for, in the Fall of 1890, “Andy” Burke, the former
ragged New York street boy, became Governor Andrew
H. Burke, of North Dakota.</p>

<p>Closely paralleling his career is that of another
New York child derelict, taken in charge about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
same time as young Burke, and, by a curious coincidence,
a companion of his in the little party of boys
sent to Indiana in 1859 by the Children’s Aid Society.
The name of this other lad was John G. Brady.
Before coming into the keeping of the Society he
had been deserted by his father, after the death of
his mother. He was just ten years old when Mr.
John Green, of Tipton, agreed to give him a home.</p>

<p>And it was a good home that Mr. Green gave him,
a home in which he was taught the value of hard,
earnest work, and of love for God and his fellow-man.
Remaining on the farm until he was eighteen,
he then became a school-teacher, saved enough out
of his scanty earnings to give him a start at college,
and three years later entered Yale. By this time he
had made up his mind to devote his life to the twofold
cause of religion and social service; and in 1874,
having graduated with credit from Yale, he became
a student in the Union Theological Seminary.
After his ordination he went as a missionary to
Alaska, where his labours, both religious and secular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
won him a firm place in the affections of the people,
and lasting recognition as one of the real makers of
that distant Territory. He was appointed governor
of Alaska by President McKinley in 1897, and
reappointed by President Roosevelt, serving three
terms.</p>

<p>Further, the records show that one ward of the
Children’s Aid Society of New York rose to be a
supreme court justice, another became chief executive
of a Western city, while a third was elected
auditor-general of a State. Two were elected to
Congress, nine to State legislatures, and about a
score to public offices of less importance. Twenty-four
became clergymen; thirty-five, lawyers; nineteen,
physicians; sixteen, journalists; twenty-nine,
bankers; eighty-six, teachers; seven, high-school
principals; two, school superintendents; and two, college
professors. Farming, the army and navy, and
various mercantile pursuits gave occupation to most
of the rest.</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered, in view of such a showing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
that most authorities are inclining more and more
to find in a faulty environment rather than in a bad
heredity the explanation of the boy who “goes
wrong”? Not that it is as yet possible, and perhaps
it never will be possible, to rule out entirely
the idea of the “born criminal.” A small proportion
of delinquents undoubtedly do show, almost from
infancy, an irresistible and seemingly instinctive impulse
to evil; but to just what extent this is due
to inherited and irremediable conditions remains to
be ascertained. Medical progress, indeed, is constantly
making it clearer that many supposed instances
of “innate depravity” are in reality the result
of curable physical defects, and sometimes of
defects that are comparatively slight.</p>

<p>To give a typical example, Professor Lightner
Witmer, Director of the Psychological Clinic of the
University of Pennsylvania, was once consulted
about an eleven-year-old boy, of good family, who
had been pronounced by several New York specialists
“mentally defective” and “certain to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
unmanageable.” His father reported that he was
unable to do correctly simple sums in addition and
subtraction, and could not read a simple sentence
without making a number of mistakes; also that he
was cowardly, bad-tempered, and quarrelsome. In
fine, the statements made concerning him seemed to
stamp him as a fit subject for institutional care.
But Professor Witmer’s preliminary testing caused
him to take a somewhat hopeful view of the poor
youngster’s condition.</p>

<p>“He was,” Professor Witmer says, in an interesting
report he has made regarding the case (<cite>The
Psychological Clinic</cite>, vol. ii, pp. 153–179), “a stocky,
well-built, healthy-looking child. He had red hair,
and the expression of his face suggested an unsteady
temper. The brow was low, but not of a character
to awaken a suspicion of mental deficiency. The
shape of the aperture of the eyes indicated a possible
arrest of fœtal development, but this was the only
suspicious symptom. The teeth were in good condition,
the mouth closed, the nose undeveloped, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
nostrils small. A hasty examination showed the necessity
of consulting an oculist, and the appearance
of the nose and nostrils called for an examination of
the naso-pharynx. The chest was fairly well developed,
the voice was good, but he had a lisp, and his
speech was a trifle thick. Hearing was normal. His
manners at table were good. His gait was normal,
the knee-jerks were present on both sides, the coordination
of the hands was good.</p>

<p>“In his conversation with me and with his family,
he seemed to me to be a normal boy of eleven, rather
alert mentally, a self-contained, independent sort of
boy. If I had visited the family casually, I would
not have observed anything wrong with him. My
first brief examination was therefore negative, and
excepting for the history which the father and
mother gave, I should have pronounced the boy normal,
but probably suffering from some optical defect
and from naso-pharyngeal obstruction.”</p>

<p>A more thorough examination confirmed this tentative
diagnosis. Although nothing of the sort had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
previously been suspected, it was discovered that the
little fellow was nearly blind in one eye. Also he was
suffering from a poor circulation. On the other
hand, despite his mental retardation a careful psychological
examination showed that naturally he was
bright enough. It seemed evident to Professor Witmer,
consequently, that the chief cause for the boy’s
mental and moral defects lay in improper upbringing,
plus the eye-strain which had undoubtedly made
school work difficult for him, and had in addition
been a source of neural irritation. In verification of
this, after he had been provided with eye-glasses and
given a few months of special training in the hospital
school connected with the psychological clinic, the
supposedly “feebleminded child” not only made
rapid headway when placed in a regular school, but
also showed a surprising moral improvement.</p>

<p>Even diseases of the teeth may play no small part
in the making of the wayward boy. There was
brought one day to Professor Witmer’s clinic a
youngster who for months had been the despair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
his parents. He had got completely beyond the control
of both home and school discipline; spent his
days idling in the streets; seemed incapable of telling
the truth; stole all sorts of small articles belonging
to his parents, including his father’s watch, which
he sold for five cents; and had even begun to steal
from the neighbours, a weakness which soon brought
him into the clutches of the law. Placed on probation
by the judge of the juvenile court, he had behaved
as badly as ever, until, as a last resort, it was
decided to see what the psychological clinic could do
for him.</p>

<p>Beyond indications of some slight eye-strain nothing
specially abnormal was found in his physical
condition until his mouth was examined. Then it
was seen that a number of his first teeth had not been
shed, and that the second teeth were forcing their
way out alongside the old ones, causing the gums to
be greatly swollen and inflamed. Taken at once to
the dental clinic he was examined more carefully by
Dean Edward C. Kirk, who, advising gradual re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>moval
of the lingering first teeth, suggested the possibility
that when the boy was relieved of all dental
stress his conduct would show marked improvement.
The outcome fully justified this suggestion. Says
Doctor Arthur Holmes, who watched the case closely
in all its stages (<cite>The Psychological Clinic</cite>, vol. iv, pp.
19–22):</p>

<p>“In spite of Harry’s rebellion and loudly expressed
fear, he was immediately relieved of one outgrown
canine tooth. The effect was almost instantaneous.
His whole nervous system seemed to express
itself in one sigh of relief.... From that time
his improvement has been marked and continuous.
His teeth were removed gradually as it was found
expedient. Closely associated with this dental condition,
and possibly aggravated by it, was an eye
weakness discovered at the eye clinic. In order to
insure proper treatment, Harry was placed in charge
of the social worker of the psychological clinic, who
saw that the drops were regularly put in his eyes,
accompanied him to the eye specialist, and not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
secured glasses for him but accomplished the hitherto
impossible feat of making him wear them.</p>

<p>“On account of the dental work and the refraction
of his eyes, he was not sent back to public school.
Through the psychological clinic a private school
was found where the boy could receive the intelligent
and sympathetic training he needed. His whole demeanour
under the private instruction has been that
of a normal boy. He has been put upon his honour
and trusted in numberless ways, and in every case he
has justified the expectations of his teacher. He is
now a healthy boy, with a boy’s natural curiosity,
with good manners, good temper, with no more than
the average nervousness, and with every prospect of
taking his proper place in society and developing into
an efficient and moral citizen.”</p>

<p>A still more remarkable case that has recently
come to my knowledge concerns a Cleveland youth
who, up to the age of sixteen, had been a model of
good conduct. Then, having gone through high
school and begun work with a business firm, he sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>denly
developed thieving tendencies, finally breaking
into a post-office, an exploit which earned for him a
term in a reformatory. This was so far from curing
him that soon after his release he adventured into
highway robbery, was caught, and was sent to jail.</p>

<p>So sudden and startling had been the change in
his behaviour that the Cleveland police authorities
were convinced he was not responsible for his actions,
and advised his mother to have him committed to an
asylum for the insane. Before taking this extreme
step she had him examined by a neurologist, Doctor
Henry S. Upson, whose careful testing of the boy
failed to disclose any signs of organic brain trouble.
Dr. Upson noticed, however, that his teeth were badly
decayed, and this led him to suggest an X-ray examination,
as a result of which it was discovered that
the youthful criminal was suffering from several abscessed
and impacted teeth.</p>

<p>Following an operation for their removal, there
was a steady improvement in his moral as well as his
physical health. When his term of imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
was at an end he found work in a printing-shop, and
at last accounts, a year after the operation, had won
for himself the reputation of being “quiet and industrious,
self-controlled, and without any indication
of either moral or mental aberration.” (<cite>The Psychological
Clinic</cite>, vol. iv, pp. 150–153.)</p>

<p>In a single institution—the New York Juvenile
Asylum—it was found that the degeneracy of 20
per cent. of a group of fifty “bad boys,” who were
mentally as well as morally backward, was due in
great measure to similar trivial physical defects,
adenoids, enlarged glands, eye and ear troubles, etc.
Not so very long ago these boys, like the boys in the
individual instances mentioned, would have been
deemed the hopeless victims of a bad heredity. It is
therefore fair to assume that in time to come other
remediable, but as yet unsuspected, physical causes
of imperfect mental and moral functioning will be
discovered.</p>

<p>This is not to say that in such cases medication
or the surgeon’s knife will prove all-sufficient to pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>vent
the transition from “naughtiness” into outright
vice and crime. To this end good moral training
will still be the indispensable safeguard, and particularly
the moral training to be had through the
subtle influence of a good home and good associates.
Surely as, for example, the results of the activities
of the New York Children’s Aid Society strongly
suggest, the home and the companions of youth are
the great determinants of character. As has been
so well said by Doctor Paul Dubois, the eminent
Swiss physician and philosopher (“Reason and Sentiment,”
pp. 69–71):</p>

<p>“If you have the happiness to be a well-living man,
take care not to attribute the credit of it to yourself.
Remember the favourable conditions in which you
have lived, surrounded by relatives who loved you
and set you a good example; do not forget the close
friends who have taken you by the hand and led you
away from the quagmires of evil; keep a grateful
remembrance for all the teachers who have influenced
you, the kind and intelligent schoolmaster, the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>voted
pastor; realise all these multiple influences
which have made of you what you are. Then you
will remember that such and such a culprit has not
in his sad life met with these favourable conditions,
that he had a drunken father or a foolish mother,
and that he has lived without affection, exposed to
all kinds of temptation. You will then take pity
upon this disinherited man, whose mind has been
nourished upon malformed mental images, begetting
evil sentiments such as immoderate desire or social
hatred.”</p>

<p>And it is not only the homeless, deserted, or neglected
child, allowed to run wild in the streets, drifting
or forced into occupations which bring him more
or less closely into touch with the ways and haunts
of wrong-doing—it is not only this child who is
likely in time to become a wrong-doer himself. No
less than the neglected child is the “spoiled” one,
however good his heredity, apt to degenerate into delinquency,
perhaps into criminality of the worst description.
In short, to borrow Pascal’s pregnant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
phrase, every child at the outset of his life is a little
impulsive being, pushed indifferently toward good
or evil according to the influences which surround
him.</p>

<p>The blame, then, for the boy who “goes wrong”
does not rest with the boy himself, or yet with his remote
ancestors. It rests squarely with the parents
who, through ignorance or neglect, have failed to
mould him aright in the plastic days of childhood.
What is needed, especially in this complex civilisation
of ours, with its myriad incitements and temptations,
is a livelier appreciation of the responsibilities as
well as the privileges of parenthood. Most of all,
perhaps, from the point of view of coping with the
problem of wrong-doing, do parents need to appreciate
that it is in the very first years of their children’s
lives that the work of character-building
should be begun.</p>

<p>In this connection a curious story is told of a
father and mother, who, full of that sublime eagerness
for the welfare of their young which every par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>ent
ought to have, took their only child, a handsome
boy of three, to an old Greek philosopher.</p>

<p>“We want you,” said they, “to take full charge
of our child’s education, and do the best you can for
him.”</p>

<p>“How old is he?” the philosopher asked.</p>

<p>“Just three.”</p>

<p>The sage shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said, “but you have brought him
to me too late.”</p>

<p>Modern students of the nature of man are beginning
to realise that there is a world of truth in this
reply. They are beginning to realise, that, even in
the period of dawning intelligence, interests may be
created, habits formed, which all the education of
later years may not wholly eradicate. Most people,
looking back at their years of childhood, are chiefly
impressed by the fact that they remember very little
of what then happened. Actually, deep in the recesses
of their minds, they possess a subconscious
remembrance that may be both remarkably extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
and almost incredibly potent in affecting their later
development.</p>

<p>The truth of this will become increasingly evident
as we proceed. Here let us pause for only one illustrative
instance, taken from the experience of one of
the most talked about of American women, Miss
Helen Keller, who, as is well known, was left by illness
deaf, dumb, and blind when less than two years
old, but has nevertheless, by careful training, been
developed into a woman of brilliant attainments.</p>

<p>Among her many accomplishments not the least
astonishing is her power for appreciating music,
which she “hears” by placing her hand lightly on
the piano and receiving its vibrations. It occurred
to Doctor Louis Waldstein, a pioneer in the study
of subconscious mental processes, that quite possibly
her appreciation of music was connected with latent
memories of music she had heard before her illness.
To test this theory he obtained from her mother copies
of two songs which had often been sung to Miss
Keller as an infant in Alabama, but which she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
heard since. These he played in her presence, with
a remarkable effect. She became much excited,
clapped her hands, laughed, and communicated:</p>

<p>“Father carrying baby up and down, swinging
her on his knee! Black Crow! Black Crow!”</p>

<p>It was evident to all present that she had been
drawn back in memory to the surroundings of her infancy.
But no one knew what she meant by the
words “Black Crow,” until her mother, in answer
to a letter of inquiry, explained that this was the
title of a third song which her father used to sing to
her.</p>

<p>“What you wrote,” commented Mrs. Keller, “interested
us very much. The ‘Black Crow’ is her
father’s standard song, which he sings to all his children
as soon as they can sit on his knee. These are
the words, ‘Gwine ‘long down the old turn row,
something hollered, Hello, Joe,’ etc. It was a sovereign
remedy for putting them (the children) in a
good humour, and was sung to Helen hundreds of
times. It is possible that she remembers it from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
being sung to the younger children as well as herself.
The other two I am convinced she has no association
with, unless she can remember them as she
heard them before her illness. Certainly before her
illness her father used to trot her on his knee, and
sing the ‘Ten Virgins,’ and she would get down and
shout as the negroes do in church. It was very
amusing. But after she lost her sight and hearing, it
was a very painful association, and was not sung to
these two little ones” (the younger children).</p>

<p>Almost by itself this impressive bit of evidence justifies
Doctor Waldstein’s unhesitating declaration,
as set forth in his interesting book, “The Subconscious
Self”:</p>

<p>“In those early impressions of which no one seems
to be conscious, least of all the child, and which
gather up power as the rolling avalanche, the elements
are collected for future emotions, moods, acts,
that make up a greater part of the history of the
individual and of States, more effective and significant
than those that are written down in <cite>mémoires</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
however <em>intimes</em>, or that can be discovered in archives,
however ‘secret.’ The strange vagaries of affection
and passion, which affect the whole existence of men
and women—the racial and religious prejudices
that shake States and communities to their very foundations,
that make and unmake reputations, and set
the wheel of progress back into the dark ages—can
be traced to such small beginnings and into those
nooks of man’s subconscious memory.”</p>

<p>Decidedly, bearing in mind this principle of the importance
of early impressions, the education of the
child should be begun while he still is in the cradle—and
should in especial include a careful arranging
of his environment, both animate and inanimate, so
as to put most effectively into play that greatest of
all educational forces, “suggestion.”</p>

<h2>II<br /><br />

SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he term “suggestion” has of late fallen
into undeserved disrepute. To most people,
as a result of its frequent linking with
the term “hypnotism,” it implies something exceptional
and weird. Yet in reality suggestion is one
of the most universal of facts, and there is nothing
“uncanny” about it. Properly defined it means
nothing more than the intrusion of an idea into the
mind in such fashion that it is accepted automatically,
overcomes all contrary ideas, and leads to a
specific course of action. The slightest reflection
will show that this is of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Every time I yawn after having seen another person
do so, I am acting on the suggestion given to me
by his action. Every time, after reading a skilfully
worded advertisement, I buy something which I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
not really need, I am again acting under the influence
of suggestion. So, too, when, in a moment of
abstraction, I imitate any act perceived subconsciously,
as in the amusing instance related by Professor
Ochorowitz in his book, “Mental Suggestion”:</p>

<p>“My friend, P——, a man no less absent-minded
than he is keen of intellect, was playing chess in a
neighbouring room. Others of us were talking near
the door. I had made the remark that it was my
friend’s habit when he paid the closest attention to
the game to whistle an air from ‘Madame Angot.’ I
was about to accompany him by beating time on the
table. But this time he whistled something else—a
march from ‘Le Prophète.’</p>

<p>“‘Listen,’ said I to my associates, ‘we are going to
play a trick upon P——. We will order him to pass
from “Le Prophète” to “La Fille de Madame
Angot.”’</p>

<p>“First I began to drum the march; then, profiting
by some notes common to both, I passed to the
quicker and more staccato notes of my friend’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
favourite air. P—— on his part suddenly changed
the air, and began to whistle ‘Madame Angot.’
Every one burst out laughing. My friend was too
absorbed in a check to the queen to notice anything.</p>

<p>“‘Let us begin again,’ said I, ‘and go back to “Le
Prophète.”’ And straightway we had Meyerbeer
once more, with a special fugue. My friend knew
that he had whistled something, but that was all he
knew.”</p>

<p>Here, obviously, we have on the part of the man
accepting and acting on the idea suggested to him,
a temporary suspension of the critical faculty. Had
he been on the alert, had he been aware of Professor
Ochorowitz’s intention, he would never have followed
the lead thus given, refraining from doing so if only
from fear of appearing ridiculous. This element of
uncritical, automatic acceptance is fundamental in
suggestion, and it is this that makes suggestion such
a tremendously important factor in the life of the
young.</p>

<p>The child, it has often been said, is the most imita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>tive
of beings. This is only another way of saying
that childhood is the most suggestible period of life.
Precisely because the critical faculty is then undeveloped
the child readily accepts and translates into
some form of action the suggestions impinging on
his mind from the external world. Necessarily some
impressions are experienced by him more frequently
than others, and by the very fact of repetition these
tend to induce in him a more or less fixed mode of
reaction. Thus, without the slightest awareness, he
acquires good or bad “habits” of thinking and
acting, and displays moods and tendencies which,
often regarded by parents as quite inexplicable, are
the logical and inevitable product of suggestions with
which he has been bombarded since his life began.</p>

<p>In this way are to be explained many personal
characteristics often mistakenly attributed to the
influence of heredity. If a man is a “grouch,” and
his young son also displays unmistakable signs of
grouchiness, it would indeed be rash to jump to the
conclusion that the son had been born grouchy. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
may well be—the chances are, it is—that he has
acquired a grouchy turn of mind simply through
imitation of his father’s habitual attitude. “A
little girl only fifteen months old,” to quote one
observation by that careful student of child life, B.
Perez, “had already begun to imitate her father’s
frowns and irritable ways and angry voice, and very
soon after she learned to use his expressions of anger
and impatience. When three years old this child
gravely said to a visitor, with whom she argued quite
in her father’s style, ‘Do be quiet, will you? You
never let me finish my sentences.’”</p>

<p>Similarly, peculiarities that seem to be wholly
physical may thus be handed on from father to child—characteristic
gestures with the hands, pursing
of the mouth when reading, shrugging the shoulders,
etc. Even left-handedness, often conspicuous as a
family trait, is probably, in a certain proportion of
cases at all events, the result of imitation rather than
heredity. In one interesting case cited by Doctor
Waldstein (“The Subconscious Self,” pp. 56–59),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
an English lady, Miss X——, had lost her mother
when less than three years of age. A year afterward,
during her first attempts at sewing, it was
noticed that she was threading her needle with her
left hand. This had been the habit of her mother,
and Mrs. X—— herself continued throughout her
life to use her left hand in threading needles, although
she was otherwise right-handed.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said she to Doctor Waldstein, “this is
an example of inheritance, for I could not have been
taught to sew by my mother.”</p>

<p>When, however, he inquired closely into this lady’s
mental make-up, he soon discovered that she was most
impressionable, easily and unduly affected by her
surroundings, full of prejudices, and given to sudden
likes and dislikes. Manifestly, if in adult life she was
so suggestible, she must have been even more suggestible
in early childhood, and Doctor Waldstein
promptly asked himself the question:</p>

<p>“Is it not more natural to assume that the mother’s
habit of threading a needle with her left hand, wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>nessed
daily during the first three years of childhood,
left its effect upon the ductile memory of the child,
so that she adopted the same habit in the absence of
other teaching, than to assume a needle-threading
centre on the right side of the brain of this particular
individual?”</p>

<p>In view, then, of the extreme suggestibility of
childhood, and in view of the fact that under ordinary
circumstances the impressions most forcibly impinging
on a child’s mind are those emanating from his
parents, a good parental example is the first essential
in utilising the power of suggestion as an aid in education.
This may sound trite, but how many parents
appreciate all that it involves?</p>

<p>It means the regulation of the whole family life
with the special purpose of creating for the child a
ceaseless flow of suggestions which, being subconsciously
absorbed by him, will give a desirable “set”
to his mind. Not merely in their dealings with the
child but in their intercourse with one another, with
all other members of the family, even with casual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
visitors, the father and mother will have to be constantly
on the alert to manifest only those traits
which they desire to see dominant in their little one.
If they wish him to be courteous, they themselves must
be courteous; if they wish him to grow up industrious,
they must be models of enthusiastic industry; if they
wish to develop in him sentiments of unselfishness,
they must banish selfishness from their hearts.</p>

<p>In a word, they must think and behave as they
desire him to think and behave, and, so far as is
humanly possible, they must thus behave all the time.
This of course necessitates considerable self-restraint
and self-training on the parents’ part; but it is absolutely
indispensable. The child’s eyes and ears are
always wide open; his suggestibility is such that he is
prone to absorb and react to any inconsistency of
parental speech or behaviour, no matter how occasional
or seemingly insignificant it may be. If the
father, in a moment of irritation, eases his feelings
by a vigorous expletive, the mother may be horrified
next day when her little boy utters a strange-sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>ing
word. If the mother, to avoid a tiresome caller,
tells a “white lie” through the maid-servant who
answers the caller’s ring, neither father nor mother
need be astonished if their little girl unexpectedly
displays a tendency to untruthfulness; it is not a
manifestation of “innate depravity,” it is only
another illustration of the power of suggestion to
affect the growing child.</p>

<p>Even such a “small matter” as the discussion of
the news of the day may become a potent factor for
evil in the development of the child. There are not
a few parents who, entirely unmindful of their children’s
presence, retail to each other the petty chit-chat,
the scandals, the deeds of violence and crime,
which so many of our newspapers injudiciously
“feature.” At the time the child may seem to be
paying no heed to the parental discussion; but, if
only because it is a discussion between his parents, it
is certain to make a profound impression upon him,
perhaps to the extent of prompting him to imitate
the deeds in question. Hence, in his games, he plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
pirate, bandit, train-robber; and sometimes runs
away from home and “starts West,” to play bandit
and train-robber in earnest. In this way, to the
sorrowing parents’ amazement, seeds often are unwittingly
sown to grow into poisonous plants.</p>

<p>No less mischievous is the discussion, in the child’s
hearing, of such frequent subjects of conversation as
the latest musical comedy or “problem play,” the
“novel of the hour,” the fluctuations of the stock
market, the new fashions in gowns, the fortunes of
the local professional baseball team. Parents whose
interests are thus lamentably limited, or who choose
to talk about little else, need not be surprised if their
child manifests a colossal indifference to things really
worth while. For his sake, if not for their own, they
should cultivate an intelligent interest in good books,
good music, good art. Discussing these, they will
just as surely enlarge his mental and moral horizon,
as by discussing inferior themes they will limit it.</p>

<p>And—another point of prime importance—whatever
they talk about, they should make it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
practice to use only clear, correct language, and
should insist on their child doing the same. Above
all, they should not converse with him in “baby talk,”
or permit any linguistic errors he may make to go
uncorrected. They should not do this for several
reasons, chief among which is the fact that an incorrect
diction is itself a great obstacle to correct thinking.</p>

<p>“Language,” as one able student of human development,
Doctor A. A. Berle, has recently pointed
out in his valuable book for parents, “The School in
the Home,” “is the tool of knowledge. It is the
instrument by which we gain and garner information,
by which we co-ordinate what we know and make
inferences and express results. But if you blunt the
tool, not to say destroy it, before you begin to use
it, how are you ever to get knowledge in any proper
or real sense? Everything depends upon this tool.
The mastery of a proper use of the mother tongue
is the first and last requisite of sound and extensive
mental development. Language is the key to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>thing
that pertains to human life. Once get a
language and you have the key to manners, civilisation,
habits, customs, history, and all the complex
and fascinating story of humanity. Because you get
all these things by reading about them, and to read
you must know the language and you must know it
accurately and extensively, and be able to follow the
masters of it who have embodied their great ideas in
literature. That process begins almost at the cradle.
It begins by cultivating accuracy and skill in the use
of the tongue. It begins by striking at, and out,
every false thing, the moment it appears.”</p>

<p>And, commenting on the special dangers of “baby
talk,” Doctor Berle justly observes:</p>

<p>“It is not enough that a word be spoken. It
makes a great deal of difference how it is spoken.
The proper vocalisation of words has an effect upon
children, which is often, one may say generally, overlooked.
Almost everybody is fond of repeating the
baby’s efforts to talk, and ‘baby talk’ lingers in
many homes an innocent but costly pleasure, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
parents and the children alike. There are many
persons of mature age at this moment who will never
pronounce certain words properly, since they became
accustomed to a false pronunciation in childhood,
because somebody thought it was ‘cute.’ There are
many persons who will never get over certain false
associations of ideas, because somebody thought it
was very amusing and funny to see the child mixing
up things in such a beautifully childlike way.”</p>

<p>Putting into practice this first principle of education
through the suggestive power of a parental
example characterised by correctness of speech,
soundness of thought, and the moral qualities of
cheerfulness, unselfishness, kindness, politeness, industriousness,
and the other virtues, the greatest care
must also be taken to “fertilise” the child’s mind
through proper adjustment of his physical surroundings.
Nothing is more certain—and least appreciated
by the average parent—than the fact that
every detail in the child’s material environment is of
suggestive significance to him. Even the pictures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the walls of his room, the design and arrangement of
the furniture and ornaments, the pattern and colouring
of the wall-paper, may play a decisive part in
shaping his character and quickening or deadening
his intellectual activities. For the matter of that, as
observation and experiment have repeatedly demonstrated,
adults almost as much as children react to
the suggestive influence of their home environment,
even to the extent at times of thereby being unfavourably
affected in health.</p>

<p>That is why sick people are so frequently benefited
by change of scene. Travel removes them from the
baneful influence of their accustomed environment,
and assists in breaking down the mental habits injurious
to their well-being. Too often, however, to
their bitter disappointment, they suffer a relapse
after returning home. Yet they need not remain
abroad indefinitely in order to obtain a lasting cure.
In many instances they need not go abroad at all,
but can secure the desired result by making a change
in their home surroundings. A most instructive case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
in point is afforded by an experience that occurred to
Mr. Frank Alvah Parsons, a practical psychologist
as well as a successful teacher of art in New York
city.</p>

<p>The mother of one of Mr. Parsons’ pupils had long
been regarded as a hopeless sufferer from “nerves.”
She lived in a suburban town, not many miles from
New York, but her condition was such that it had
been months since she visited that city, and usually
she remained at home, secluded in a private apartment,
of sitting-room and bedroom.</p>

<p>One day, having occasion to call on her, Mr. Parsons
was much impressed with the fact that the
furniture and decorations of both these rooms were
exceedingly faulty from a psychological as well as an
æsthetic point of view. The walls of the sitting-room
were hung with mirrors, and the room was fairly
smothered with bric-a-brac. In both rooms the
colouring and design of the wall-paper contrasted
harshly with the floor-coverings, while the furniture,
though expensive, was gaudy and inharmonious. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
talked the situation over with her daughter, and between
them they persuaded her to allow them to make
radical alterations in the furnishings of her rooms.</p>

<p>They papered the walls with a soft sage-green
paper, without design. The woodwork was made
lighter, with a shade of green in it. A brass bedstead
was installed, the yellow of the brass blending well
with the green of the paper and woodwork. The
bric-a-brac was unceremoniously bundled out, and,
excepting for a few green draperies and some well-chosen
pictures, the rooms were left without ornament.
Mahogany furniture, of a quiet, dignified
style, replaced the gilded chairs and tables previously
there.</p>

<p>The effect was to substitute for the former nerve-irritating
environment one that gave out a constant
stream of restful, soothing, strengthening suggestions;
and the therapeutic value of the change was
increased by Mr. Parsons wisely insisting that the
patient should not leave the refurnished rooms for
two weeks. He desired to expose her, at once and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
systematically, to the full suggestive effect of her
new surroundings. At the end of a month, although
she had been told that she would be an invalid for
life, she felt strong enough to undertake a shopping
expedition to New York, and soon was as well as in
her earlier days of robust health.</p>

<p>In this case, of course, the cure was effected at a
cost beyond the means of most people. It is not
everybody who can afford to refurnish and redecorate
his living-quarters. But the point is that everybody
can so arrange his environment to begin with as
to extract from it suggestions that will assist in maintaining
his health and happiness, and in promoting
the proper upbringing of his children. This is
equally within the reach of a dweller in a Fifth Avenue
mansion, a Newport palace, a crowded East Side
tenement, or a lonely, isolated farm-house, miles from
the nearest village. I might cite many illustrative
instances to bear out this statement. Here is one,
reported by an observant New York physician:</p>

<p>“The refined tastes and joyous dispositions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the elder children in a family with whom I often came
into contact were a matter of some surprise to me,
as I could not account for the common trait among
them by the position or special characteristics of the
parents: they were in the humblest position socially,
and all but poor. My first visit to their modest home
furnished me with the natural solution, and gave me
much food for reflection.</p>

<p>“The children—there were six—occupied two
rooms into which the sunlight was pouring as I
entered; the remaining rooms of the apartment were
sunless for the greater part of the day; the colour
and design of the cheap wall-paper were cheerful and
unobtrusive; bits of carpet, the table-cover, and the
coverlets on the beds were all in harmony, and of
quiet design in nearly the elementary colours; everything
in these poor rooms of poor people had been
chosen with the truest judgment for æsthetic effect,
and yet the mother seemed surprised that I could
make so much of what seemed to her so simple.”</p>

<p>That colours have a profound psychological effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
on human beings is a fact which should be appreciated
far more generally than is now the case. Used
in small quantities, either in the clothing or in household
decoration, the colour red, for instance, is most
stimulating, both in the way of helping to overcome
depression, and quickening the intellectual processes.
But when used in any great amount it tends to over-stimulation,
with resultant nerve-strain. According
to an English savant, Havelock Ellis, who has
made a careful study of the psychology of colours,
there are some people so constituted that they become
violently excited, fall into convulsions, or faint, if
obliged even for a short time to look at anything
vividly red.</p>

<p>The same effect has been noted from yellow. In
one instance, the case of a man operated on at the
age of thirty for congenital cataract, it is recorded
that “the first time he saw yellow, he became so sick
that he thought he would vomit.” And that yellow
has a nerve-stimulating effect fully comparable with
that of red is curiously indicated by the statement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
a friend of mine, a professor in a Western university,
who says:</p>

<p>“Whenever the day is overcast, or I have to do a
piece of work calling for unusual mental exertion, I
always wear a red or yellow necktie. I find that
either colour has a stimulating effect on my mental
processes.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the colour violet appears to
have a deadening effect. Another acquaintance, a
member of the Harvard University professorial staff,
and a well-known psychologist, assures me that the
sight of anything violet almost nauseates him, and
gives rise to a most depressed feeling. In such a
case, however, it may be that the colour is subconsciously
associated with some unpleasant occurrence
in the earlier life, and that the nausea and depression
are merely symbolical manifestations of the presence
in the subconsciousness of some memory of this occurrence,
concerning which there is no conscious
recollection. (This important point will later be
discussed in detail.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>Of more immediate significance is the fact that
violet rays are sometimes used to quiet unruly
patients in asylums for the insane, and that the
alienist Osburne, after many years’ experience, testifies
that “in the absence of structural disease, violet
light—for from three to six hours—is most useful
in the treatment of excitement, sleeplessness, and
acute mania.”</p>

<p>Altogether, there is warrant for the assertion that
red, yellow, and violet are colours that should not be
used overmuch, either in one’s apparel or in the
decorating of one’s home. Blue, green, grey, and
brown, on the contrary, have psychological qualities
that make them particularly desirable for decorative
purposes.</p>

<p>Care must always be exercised, though, to work
out a colour scheme that harmonises, since discordant
colour effects inevitably carry to the mind suggestions
of discordant thinking and feeling and doing.
As a first aid to the study of colour harmony—a subject
which, as soon as its significance to human wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>fare
is more generally recognised, will be taught far
more systematically than at present—I recommend
painstaking observation of the colour schemes developed
by master artists, as shown in the paintings
to be seen in the art museums of our cities; or, better
still, excursions into the country, where, in the colour
combinations of earth and sky, tree and water, mountainside
and valley meadow, one can gain invaluable
hints from that greatest of artists, Nature. On such
excursions, need I add, the children should be taken
along, to receive early lessons in the appreciation of
true beauty.</p>

<p>But now, while thus utilising to the full the educational
possibilities opened by the suggestibility of
childhood—while reinforcing the educational value
of example by the educational value of a well-arranged
home environment—it must also be recognised
that the child’s extreme suggestibility carries
with it certain dangers. As was said, the essential
element in every successful suggestion is the automatic,
uncritical acceptance of whatever idea is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
intruded into the mind. It goes without saying
that, so long as the critical faculty remains unawakened
and untrained, it will always be possible to
intrude by suggestion erroneous as well as sound
ideas.</p>

<p>More serious still, there is warrant for adding that
unless the child’s critical powers be developed at an
early age—unless he be taught from the outset of
his life how to observe accurately and reason closely—the
tendency to uncritical acceptance may become
more or less of a habit. That, under present conditions
of child training, this is a real danger is clearly
shown by the results of recent experiments by French
and German psychologists.</p>

<p>In Germany, Kosog, visiting a school-room before
the beginning of the lesson-hour, placed three objects,
a pen-holder, a pocket-knife, and a piece of chalk, so
near the edge of the teacher’s desk that they could be
plainly seen by every pupil in the room. During the
brief recess that followed the first lesson-hour, he
removed these objects, and after the pupils had re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>assembled
asked them what they had seen on the desk
the previous hour. Hardly one of them, it turned
out, had noticed the objects at all. Next day, <em>after
leaving the desk entirely bare the first hour</em>, he put
the same question to them at the beginning of the
second hour. Now 26 per cent. of the pupils asserted
that they had seen the pocket-knife, 57 per cent. the
chalk, and 63 per cent. the pen-holder.</p>

<p>In France, the headmaster of a school, following
the instructions of the famous psychologist, Alfred
Binet, announced to a class of eighty-six boys that he
intended to test their memory of the length of lines.
A line two inches long, ruled on white cardboard, was
shown to each boy, who, after looking at it, had to
draw it as accurately as he could on a sheet of paper.
The boys were then told that they would be asked to
draw another line a little longer than the first, and
were accordingly given a second line to copy. In
reality it was shorter than the first, being only an
inch and three quarters long. Yet out of the entire
class only nine resisted the suggestion and believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
their eyes and their memories rather than the master’s
statement. The other seventy-seven boys—some of
whom were fourteen years old—made the second line
longer than the first.</p>

<p>A variation of the same experiment was made on
another class, to whom a series of thirty-six lines was
shown, one after the other. Of these lines the first
five progressively increased in length, while the remainder
were uniformly long. Not one of the forty-two
boys who were asked to copy them reached the
maximum length at the fifth line, while nine industriously
continued making their lines longer up to the
last line shown them. The first five lines, that is to
say, had acted as a suggestion having sufficient force
to induce in them, despite the evidence of their eyes,
a belief that the entire series similarly increased in
length.</p>

<p>Much the same thing, as everyday observation
shows, occurs in the case of full-grown men and
women. The judicious have long grieved at the gullibility
with which people who are by no means illiterate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and uneducated accept and act upon the most preposterous
suggestions of the fraudulent advertiser,
from the patent-medicine man to the swindling promoter.
Political mountebanks and charlatans daily
ride into power through nothing else than skilfully
working on the suggestibility of the voters. So, too,
religious cults, no matter how fantastic, gain a foothold
and a following. “I am Elijah,” some one announces,
and straightway a multitude proclaim him
Elijah. “There is no such thing as disease,” says
another, and thousands take up the cry, accepting
the absurd suggestion with as much unthinking
readiness as was shown by the French boys who,
although they had concrete evidence to the contrary,
accepted their master’s deceptive statements.</p>

<p>What these, and even more glaring evidences of
undue suggestibility, really mean is that there is
something wrong with our educational methods.
Appreciating this, there is an increasing tendency to
criticise and condemn the school system. “Our
common schools,” exclaims President Emeritus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Charles W. Eliot, of Harvard University, “have
failed signally to cultivate general intelligence, as is
evinced by the failure to deal adequately with the
liquor problem, by the prevalence of gambling, of
strikes accompanied by violence, and by the persistency
of the spoils system.” From the standpoint
also of mere efficiency much complaint is made. The
charge is even heard that the public schools of to-day
make for mediocrity, and that instead of fostering
they in reality retard the development of a child’s
intellect. In the words of a recent critic (<cite>The Psychological
Clinic</cite>, vol. iv., p. 141):</p>

<p>“The public school attempts the impossible feat
of making a course for all children, irrespective of
strength, mentality, inheritance, or home environment—whether
they are to be lawyers or blacksmiths,
artisans or mathematicians. Plainly, this
course cannot suit all children. Is it, then, adapted
to the bright child? Doctor Witmer, Professor of
Psychology in the University of Pennsylvania, says,
‘The public schools are not giving the bright child a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
square deal. He is marking time, waiting for the
lame duck to catch up.’ Is the course intended to fit
the dull pupil? Evidently not, in view of the tears
shed by the many who, despite their efforts, fail to
keep up to grade.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested that the course has been
designed for the average pupil. The ‘average’
pupil does not exist. You cannot strike an average
between a goose and an eagle, nor can you add a dull
pupil and a bright pupil together and get anything.
A course of study based on this idea is not fitted to
any one. Instead, then, of a school to fit the pupil,
the pupil is made to fit the school. The lock-step
masquerades under the name of discipline. The rigid
curriculum tends with each passing year to produce
more and more the type of factory employés, obliterating
individuality and forcing all into the same
mould.”</p>

<p>That there is a large measure of truth in these
criticisms cannot be denied, and our school authorities
to-day are bestirring themselves to effect sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
greatly needed reforms. But is it wholly fair to cast
on the schools the blame for human irrationalities of
thought and conduct? Nay, is it not possible, in
view of the fact that habits are formed so early in
life, that the real trouble may be that the material
with which the schools have to work—the children
of the nation—is more or less unworkable by the
time it gets to the schools? Is it not reasonable to
assume that neglect of proper instruction in the pre-school
period has permitted the formation of faulty
and well-nigh unchangeable modes of thinking and
feeling?</p>

<p>“But,” I hear a puzzled parent protest, “do you
mean that the formal education of the child should be
begun before he has reached school age? Would you
have us lay on the tender mind the burden of actual
study?”</p>

<p>I mean precisely that. Not only do I believe that
the postponement of formal education to “school
age” is a serious pedagogical error, but I also believe
that “actual study,” properly directed, would by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
means prove such a “burden” on the mind of the
child as most people take for granted.</p>

<p>I am willing to go further than this, and to contend,
for reasons which I shall endeavour to make
clear, that if the formal education of children were
begun earlier than is the rule at present, and if it were
carried out with the supplementary aid of education
through a really good example and a really well arranged
environment, our boys and girls would develop
not only into morally superior men and women, but
also into men and women of mental attainments fairly
comparable with those to-day displayed by the comparative
few acclaimed as men and women of
“genius.”</p>

<h2>III<br /><br />

THE SECRET OF GENIUS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he theory of genius which it is my purpose
to present and defend has little in common
with the views held by most students
of this world-old problem. Especially does it differ
from the well-known and at present dominant doctrine
of the Moreau-Lombroso-Hagen school of investigators,
by whom the man of genius is regarded as
an aberrant, even degenerate, type of humanity,
closely allied to the insane, and hence by implication
deserving to be repressed rather than encouraged.
Nor am I at one with those who, justly protesting
against the degeneracy theory, themselves contend
that genius is an anomaly in the scheme of Nature,
and that the man of genius, biologically speaking, is
a “variation” dependent on unknown, perhaps unknowable,
laws of heredity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>On the contrary, following the lead of the late
Frederic W. H. Myers—the first, in my opinion, to
glimpse the true significance and fundamental characteristics
of genius—I shall endeavour to show that
in the man of genius there is, at bottom, no real departure
from normality, and that he differs from the
“average man” only in being the fortunate possessor
of a power for utilising more freely than other men
faculties common to all. More than this, going beyond
Myers, I venture to affirm that genius is to an
appreciable extent susceptible of cultivation, so as
to become a far more frequent phenomenon than it is
to-day.</p>

<p>In other words, I maintain that God, in giving to
the world its Dantes, Newtons, and Emersons, has
not intended them as mere objects of admiration and
bewilderment, but as indications of possibilities open
to the generalty of mankind.</p>

<p>Such a view, it may at once be conceded, could not
reasonably have been advanced many years ago. It
rests mainly on facts then unknown or misunderstood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and even now little appreciated outside of a narrow
circle of scientific investigators. Foremost in importance
is the discovery that, in addition to the
ordinary realm of conscious thought, there exists in
all of us a second realm—that of the so-called subconscious—in
which, quite without any will-directed
effort of our own, the most varied mental processes
are carried on.</p>

<p>The subconscious, in fact, is a kind of vast store-house,
wherein are preserved, seemingly without time
limit and in the most perfect detail, memory-images
of everything we have seen, heard, or otherwise experienced
through our sense-organs. It is also a kind
of workshop for the facile manipulation of ideas, including
even the elaboration of complicated trains of
thought. Manifestly, the more freely and habitually
one can draw on its resources, the more one ought to
be able to accomplish with regard to any set task or
chosen field of work. And in this, I am persuaded,
we have the clue to the true explanation of the brilliant
achievements of the man of genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>He does what he does so well, not because he is of
an abnormal type of mentality, as the Lombrosians
ask us to believe, nor yet because he is born with gifts
transcending those of other men, but simply because
he has found a way more readily, more frequently,
and more profitably than others to avail himself of
the subconscious powers that are the common heritage
of the race. Or, to put it more elaborately in
the words of Frederic Myers:</p>

<p>“I would suggest that genius—if that vaguely
used word is to receive anything like a psychological
definition—should be regarded as a power of utilising
a wider range than other men can utilise of
faculties in some degree innate in all—a power of
appropriating the results of subliminal mentation to
subserve the supraliminal stream of thought; so that
an ‘inspiration of genius’ will be, in truth, a subliminal
uprush, an emergence into the current of ideas
which the man is consciously manipulating of other
ideas which he has not consciously originated, but
which have shaped themselves beyond his will in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>founder
regions of his being. I would urge that here
there is no real departure from normality; no abnormality,
at least in the sense of degeneration; but,
rather, a fulfilment of the true norm of man.”</p>

<p>That the inspirations of genius are really nothing
more than spontaneous upsurgings from the depths
of the subconscious, is indeed demonstrable from the
recorded statements of men of genius themselves. To
the modern psychologist one of the most impressive
proofs of the actuality of subconscious mental processes,
is the occasional solution in dreams of problems
that have long baffled the waking consciousness.
In this way abstruse mathematical problems have
sometimes been worked out after all hope of solving
them had been abandoned; and troublesome clerical
errors, the perpetual dread of book-keepers, have
been cleared away during sleep, as in the following
typical instance, reported by a successful business
man to the Society for Psychical Research:</p>

<p>“I had been bothered since September with an
error in my cash account for that month, and, despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
many hours’ examination, it defied all my efforts, and
I had almost given it up as a hopeless case. It had
been the subject of my waking thoughts for many
nights, and had occupied a large portion of my leisure
hours. Matters remained thus unsettled until December
11. On this night I had not, to my knowledge,
once thought of the subject, but I had not been
long in bed, and <em>asleep</em>, when my brain was as busy
with the books as if I had been at my desk. The
cash-book, banker’s pass-book, etc., appeared before
me, and without any apparent trouble I almost immediately
discovered the cause of the mistake, which
had arisen out of a complicated cross-entry.</p>

<p>“I perfectly recollect having taken a slip of paper
in my dream and making such a memorandum as
would enable me to correct the error at some leisure
time; having done this, the whole of the circumstances
had passed from my mind. When I awoke in the
morning I had not the slightest recollection of my
dream, nor did it once occur to me during the day,
although I had the very books before me on which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
had apparently been engaged in my sleep. When I
returned home in the afternoon, as I did early for the
purpose of dressing, and proceeded to shave, I took
up a piece of paper from my dressing-table to wipe
my razor, and you may imagine my surprise at finding
thereon the very memorandum I fancied had been
made during the night.</p>

<p>“The effect on me was such that I returned to our
office and turned to the cash-book, when I found that
I had really, <em>when asleep</em>, detected the error which I
could not detect in my waking hours, and had actually
jotted it down at the time.”</p>

<p>The modern psychological explanation of all this
would be that in his many hours of searching through
the books he had, though without being in the least
aware of it, gradually brought together the data necessary
to the solution of his problem; and that in this
case this happened to be first definitely formulated in
his mind while he slept, thus giving rise to the dream
that caused him such astonishment. Or he might
from the outset have subconsciously been aware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the cause of his error, but without being able to
profit from the knowledge until a favouring condition
in sleep permitted its emergence above the threshold
of his consciousness.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that instead of being a business man
he had been a novelist, artist, or musician, and had
been preoccupied with some special or general problem
peculiar to his art. If in that event he had had
a dream in which was presented to his sleeping consciousness
a plot or subject or theme, which, being
afterward given permanent form on paper or canvas,
proved to have the qualities of a “work of genius,”
would it not be logical to infer that precisely the
same mental processes were operant in the second
instance as in the first, the only difference being in the
character of the product? This is what, from their
own statement, has happened to not a few men of high
achievement.</p>

<p>Coleridge’s poem “Kubla Khan” was a dream
composition. So was the sonata by which the composer
Tartini is best known, and to which he appro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>priately
gave the name of “The Devil’s Sonata,” in
recognition of the fact that he owed it to a dream of
selling his soul to the devil, and being rewarded by
hearing the latter play on a violin the music out of
which grew what Tartini himself regarded as his best
piece of work. Benjamin Franklin was another man
of genius who gained something from his dreams, as
was Condillac. But the most striking illustration is
afforded by Robert Louis Stevenson, whose marvellous
“Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” was only one of
several novels and stories that he conceived in dreams.
Stevenson, it is worth adding, in his delightful
“Chapter on Dreams,” frankly recognises and acknowledges
the debt he owed to his subconsciousness,
which, with characteristic felicity and whimsicality,
he personified as “Brownies” and “little people.”</p>

<p>“This dreamer, like many other persons,” is the
way he puts it, “has encountered some trifling vicissitudes
of fortune. When the bank begins to send
letters and the butcher to linger at the back gate, he
sets to belabouring his brains after a story, for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
is his readiest bread-winner; and, behold! at once the
little people begin to bestir themselves in the same
quest, and labour all night long, and all night long set
before him truncheons of tales upon their lighted
theatre. No fear of his being frightened now; the
flying heart and the frozen scalp are things bygone;
applause, growing applause, growing interest, growing
exultation in his own cleverness—for he takes
all the credit—and at last a jubilant leap to wakefulness,
with the cry ‘I have it; that’ll do!’ upon his
lips—with such and similar emotions he sits at these
nocturnal dramas; with such outbreaks, like Cassius
in the play, he scatters the performance in the
midst.</p>

<p>“Often enough the waking is a disappointment.
He has been too deep asleep, as I explain the thing;
drowsiness has gained his little people; they have gone
stumbling and maundering through their parts; and
the play, to the wakened mind, is seen to be a tissue
of absurdities. And yet, how often have these sleepless
Brownies done him honest service, and given him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as he sat idly taking his pleasure in the boxes, better
tales than he could fashion for himself.</p>

<p>“The more I think of it,” Stevenson goes on, “the
more I am moved to press upon the world my question,
‘Who are the little people?’ They are near
connections of the dreamer’s, beyond doubt; they
share in his training; they have plainly learned, like
him, to build the scheme of a considerable story, and
to arrange emotion in progressive order. Only, I
think they have more talent; and one thing is beyond
doubt—they can tell him a story piece by piece, like
a serial, and keep him the while in ignorance of where
they aim.</p>

<p>“That part of my work which is done while I am
sleeping is the Brownies’ part, beyond contention;
but that which is done when I am up and about is by
no means necessarily mine, since all goes to show that
the Brownies have a hand in it even then.”</p>

<p>Than these exquisite paragraphs, it would be hard
to find—and I have quoted them for that reason—anything
more graphically descriptive of the mechan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>ism
which I am convinced is always operant in the
production of works of genius. Asleep or awake, it is
from the resources of the subconscious region of their
minds that men of genius gain the “inspirations”
that delight, benefit, or amaze posterity.</p>

<p>Mostly, of course, the subconscious upsurgings
come to them when they are awake, sometimes in
momentary gleams of insight, sometimes continuing
through comparatively long periods, when they write,
compose, or develop valuable discoveries without conscious
effort. In fact, there even is one type of
genius—although by no means the most useful—in
which, within a certain limited field, the subconscious
is perpetually in evidence, and perpetually responsive
to the demands of the upper consciousness. I refer
to the so-called “lightning calculators,” those
prodigies whose mathematical feats, performed without
the aid of pencil and paper, have been a source of
unending surprise to the world, and have at times
been so remarkable as to be well-nigh incredible.</p>

<p>Thus, Zerah Colburn, an American lightning calcu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>lator,
when only six years old, unable to read, and
ignorant of the name and value of any numeral set
down on paper, is known to have stated correctly the
number of seconds in a period as long as two thousand
years, and to have returned the correct answer
(9,139,200) to the question, “Supposing I have a
corn-field, in which are 7 acres, having 17 rows to
each acre, 64 hills to each row, 8 ears on a hill, and
150 kernels on the ear, how many kernels in the corn-field?”</p>

<p>A little later, having been taken by his father to
England, it is recorded that, in the presence of a
number of witnesses:</p>

<p>“He undertook and succeeded in raising the number
8 to the sixteenth power, 281,474,976,780,656.
He was then tried as to other numbers, consisting of
one figure, all of which he raised as high as the tenth
power, with so much facility that the person appointed
to take down the results was obliged to enjoin
him not to be too rapid. With respect to numbers
of two figures, he would raise some of them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
sixth, seventh, and eighth power, but not always with
equal facility; for the larger the products became the
more difficult he found it to proceed. He was asked
the square root of 106,929, and before the number
could be written down he immediately answered 327.
He was then requested to name the cube root of 268,336,125,
and with equal facility and promptness he
replied 645.”</p>

<p>Henri Mondeux, Vito Mangiamele, Jacques Inaudi,
Zacharias Dase, Jedediah Buxton, Truman Safford,
André Ampère, Karl Gauss, George Bidder and his
son of the same name, were other world famous calculators.
From some of them direct evidence as to the
subconscious character of their calculations has been
forthcoming. One of the most remarkable in this
group, the elder Bidder, in a paper contributed to a
scientific journal, declared, “Whenever I feel called
upon to make use of the stores of my mind, they seem
to rise with the rapidity of lightning.” In a later
issue of the same journal it is asserted regarding him:</p>

<p>“He had an almost miraculous power of seeing, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
it were, intuitively, what factors would divide any
large number, not a prime. Thus, if he were given
the number 17,861, he would instantly remark that
it was 327 × 53. He could not, he said, explain how
he did this; it seemed a natural instinct with him.”</p>

<p>Another expert calculator, an English civil engineer
named Blyth, says in a letter:</p>

<p>“I am conscious of an intuitive recognition of the
relations of figures. For instance, in reading statements
of figures in newspapers, which are often egregiously
wrong, it seems to come to me intuitively that
something is wrong, and when that occurs I am usually
right.”</p>

<p>In the case of at least one lightning calculator
there is proof positive of the concurrent operation of
two trains of thought, the one conscious, the other
subconscious. This is Jedediah Buxton, who “would
talk freely while doing his questions, that being no
molestation or hindrance to him.”</p>

<p>Moreover, prodigious memory power is nearly
always characteristic of the lightning calculator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
This of itself is evidence of unusual access to the subconscious,
since it is in the subconscious that memories
are stored. Most impressive of all, however, is the
rapid, almost instantaneous emergence of the answers
to the problems propounded by those testing the
calculator’s powers. It is as though the mere putting
of the problem, and the mere desire to solve it, were
enough to set in motion a “thinking machine” that
automatically brought about the desired result. It
is significant that in most cases, as in Bidder’s, the
calculators themselves are unable to give any satisfactory
account of the methods they employ, and
sometimes frankly admit that they “do not know how
the answers come.”</p>

<p>Now, this sudden irruption of ideas, this dazzling
solution of problems, is characteristic not only of
calculating prodigies, but also of all men of genius.
They may not have—in truth, they have comparatively
seldom—such a spectacular resort to the subconscious;
but they assuredly have it in an astonishing measure,
and to better purpose. Precisely as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
we find the answers to mathematical puzzles rising
spontaneously in the minds of ready reckoners, so,
time and again, do we find great thoughts, amounting
it may be to epoch-making conceptions, forcing themselves
upon men of genius, frequently at moments
when they are consciously thinking of some other
matter, or are not consciously exercising their minds
at all. And again we have only to go to the published
testimony of men of genius themselves to obtain
a strong body of evidence bearing out this statement.</p>

<p>Many a poet of the first order, puzzling over the
state of his mind during his creative moments, has
declared that his works were composed as in a dream,
the main ideas, sometimes even the phrases used, shaping
themselves of their own accord in his consciousness.
“Often it happened to me,” says Goethe, “that
I would repeat a song to myself and then be unable to
recollect it; that sometimes I would run to my desk,
and, without taking time to lay my paper straight,
would, without stirring from my place, write out the
poem from beginning to end, slopingly. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
same reason I always preferred to write with a pencil,
on account of its marking so readily. On several
occasions, indeed, the scratching and spluttering of
my pen awoke me from my somnambulistic poetising
and distracted me so that it suffocated a little product
in its birth.” (Hirsch’s “Genius and Degeneration,”
p. 33.)</p>

<p>Elsewhere Goethe specifically states that his
“Werther” was written “somewhat unconsciously,
like a sleepwalker.” And, according to Vischer, the
poet Schiller, Goethe’s almost equally great contemporary,
complained that whenever he was consciously
at work creating and constructing, his imagination
was hampered and did not perform “with the same
freedom as it had done when nobody was looking over
its shoulder.”</p>

<p>“It is not I who think,” confesses Lamartine, “but
my ideas which think for me.” Dante had much the
same feeling, as recorded in his famous lines, “I am
so constituted that when love inspires me, I attend;
and according as it speaks in me, I express myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>”
Voltaire, who wrote to Diderot that “in the works
of genius instinct is everything,” on seeing one of his
own tragedies performed, exclaimed, “Was it really
I who wrote that?”</p>

<p>“My conceptions,” says Rémy de Gourmont, “rise
into the field of consciousness like a flash of lightning
or the flight of a bird.”</p>

<p>“One does not work, one listens; it is as though
another were speaking into one’s ear,” writes De
Musset. Exactly similar is the statement of the composer,
Hoffman:</p>

<p>“When I compose, I sit down to the piano, shut my
eyes, and play what I hear.”</p>

<p>From other great musicians comes equally emphatic
testimony to the part played by the subconscious in
the creation of their works. Mozart frankly avowed
that his compositions came “involuntarily, like
dreams.” Among eminent composers of to-day
Saint-Saens has only to listen, like Socrates, to his
Dæmon; and Vincent d’Indy, writing to Dr. Paul
Chabaneix (to whose “Le Subconsciente chez les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Artistes, les Savants, et les Ecrivains” I am indebted
for most of these French instances) relates that he
“often has, on waking, a fugitive glimpse of a musical
effect which—like the memory of a dream—needs
a strong immediate concentration of mind to
keep it from vanishing.”</p>

<p>The situation is the same, in whatever field genius
finds expression. Napoleon, by many considered the
greatest military genius in the history of mankind,
believed from his own experience that the fate of
battles usually turned not so much on conscious planning
and manœuvring as on tactics dictated by
“latent thoughts” arising suddenly in the mind.
“The decisive moment approached; the spark burst
forth, and one was victorious.” In like manner there
frequently has come to scientists and inventors, with
the unexpectedness of lightning out of a clear sky,
the discovery of natural laws or mechanical principles
of which they previously had no conscious knowledge
whatever.</p>

<p>Everybody has heard the story of Newton, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
falling apple, and the discovery of the law of gravitation;
and of Galileo’s invention of the pendulum, born
of the thoughts springing up in his mind while idly
watching the oscillations of the great bronze lamp
swinging from the roof of Pisa Cathedral. Not so
well known, but particularly impressive because of
its revelation of the manner in which the desultory
development of a train of thought in the mind of a
man of genius may lead to a subconscious upsurging
of the highest value, is Alfred Russel Wallace’s own
account of his epoch-making discovery of the scientific
doctrine of the origin of species—a discovery
achieved by him, in the far-off Malay Archipelago,
with no knowledge that the same doctrine had even
then been worked out, though not as yet made public,
by Charles Darwin.</p>

<p>“At the time in question,” Wallace relates, in his
“My Life,” “I was suffering from a sharp attack of
intermittent fever, and every day during the cold and
succeeding hot fits had to lie down for several hours,
during which time I had nothing to do but to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
over any subjects then particularly interesting me.
One day something brought to my mind Malthus’s
‘Principle of Population,’ which I had read about
twelve years before. I thought of his clear exposition
of the ‘positive checks to increase’—disease,
accidents, war, and famine—which keep down the
population of savage races to so much lower an
average than that of more civilised peoples. It then
occurred to me that these causes, or their equivalents,
are continually acting in the case of animals also;
and as animals usually breed much more rapidly than
does mankind, the destruction every year from these
causes must be enormous in order to keep down the
numbers of each species, since they evidently do not
increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the
world would long ago have been densely crowded
with those that breed most quickly.</p>

<p>“Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant
destruction which this implied, it occurred to
me to ask the question, Why do some die and some
live? And the answer was clearly, that on the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the best fitted live. From the effects of disease the
most healthy escaped; from enemies, the strongest,
the swiftest, or the most cunning; from famine, the
best hunters or those with the best digestion; and so
on. Then it suddenly flashed on me that this self-acting
process would necessarily <em>improve the race</em>,
because in every generation the inferior would inevitably
be killed off and the superior would remain—that
is, <em>the fittest would survive</em>.</p>

<p>“At once I seemed to see the whole effect of this,
that when changes of land and sea, or of climate, or of
food-supply, or of enemies occurred—and we know
that such changes have always been taking place—and
considering the amount of individual variation
that my experience as a collector had shown me to
exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary
for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions
would be brought about; and as great changes
in the environment are always slow, there would be
ample time for the change to be effected by the survival
of the best fitted in every generation. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
way every part of an animal’s organisation could be
modified exactly as required, and in the very process
of this modification the unmodified would die out, and
thus the <em>definite</em> characters and the clear <em>isolation</em>
of each new species would be explained. The more I
thought about it, the more I became convinced that I
had at last found the long-sought-for law of nature
that solved the problem of the origin of species.”</p>

<p>This passage, with its significant phrases, “Then it
suddenly flashed on me,” and “At once I seemed to
see the whole effect of this,” makes very clear the subconscious
element in the achieving of the momentous
discovery. It also emphasises another fact indispensable
to a complete understanding not alone of Wallace’s
achievement but of the achievements of all men
of genius: the fact that creative upsurgings from the
subconscious would be valueless—would, indeed, be
impossible of occurrence—in any but a mind rendered
by conscious study, observation, and reflection,
capable of appreciating their significance.</p>

<p>The subconscious, let me recall, is a kind of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>shop
where the “ego” rummages among the memory-images
of its past experiences to develop trains of
thought and reach definite conclusions with a minimum
of effort. Obviously the results of its rummaging
will depend on the material it finds to work
with; in proportion as this is rich and abundant, the
subconscious upsurgings will be “worth while.”
Obviously, too, both the richness of the material and
the character and value of the subconscious upsurgings
will ultimately depend on the character of the
individual’s interests, and the extent to which these
impel him to conscious study, observation, and reflection.</p>

<p>Wherefore it is that all men of genius have been
great workers. Even when, as has been observed in
certain cases, they indulge in more or less protracted
periods of idleness, they later make amends by an
unusual industry; and, for that matter, their idleness
often is more seeming than real, their minds
being busied all the while with some baffling problem.
Ardent, whole-souled absorption in the thing he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
set himself to do—that, unquestionably, is a distinguishing
characteristic of the man of genius. It
is almost as if by instinct he labours hard to provide
his subconsciousness with the data it must have in
order to afford him, by way of recompense, those
flashes of insight, those moments of “inspiration,”
that mean acknowledged leadership among his fellow-men.</p>

<p>I have already quoted Robert Louis Stevenson’s
description of what his subconscious did for him.
Let me now give his account of how he toiled to provide
his subconscious with its working material.
Never was there a man who strove more diligently
and deliberately to attain success as an author; and
this even while he was a student in college, where most
of those who knew him thought that his chief occupation
was “killing time.” As he tells us:</p>

<p>“All through my boyhood and youth I was known
and pointed out for the pattern of an idler; and yet I
was always busy on my own private end, which was
to learn to write. I kept always two books in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
pocket, one to read, one to write in. As I walked,
my mind was busy fitting what I saw with appropriate
words. When I sat by the roadside, I would either
read, or a pencil and a penny version book would be
in my hand, to write down the features of the scene or
commemorate some halting stanzas.</p>

<p>“Thus I lived with words. And what I thus wrote
was for no ulterior use; it was written consciously for
practice. It was not so much that I wished to be an
author—though I wished that, too—as that I had
vowed that I would learn to write. That was a proficiency
that tempted me; and I practised to acquire
it, as men learn to whittle, in a wager with myself....
I worked in other ways, also; often accompanied
my walks with dramatic dialogues, in which I played
many parts; and often exercised myself in writing
down conversations from memory.</p>

<p>“This was all excellent, no doubt; so were the
diaries I sometimes tried to keep, but always and very
speedily discarded, finding them a school of posturing
and melancholy self-deception. And yet this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
not the most efficient part of my training. Good
though it was, it only taught me—so far as I have
learned them at all—the lower and less intellectual
elements of the art, the choice of the essential note
and the right word; things that to a happier constitution
had perhaps come by nature. And regarded as
training it had one grave defect; for it set me no
standard of achievement.</p>

<p>“So that there was, perhaps, more profit, as there
was certainly more effort, in my secret labours at
home. Whenever I read a book or a passage that
particularly pleased me, in which a thing was said or
an effect rendered with propriety, in which there was
either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction
in the style, I must sit down at once and set myself
to ape that quality. I was unsuccessful, and I
knew it; and tried again, and was again unsuccessful,
and always unsuccessful; but at least in these vain
bouts I got some practice in rhythm, in harmony, in
construction, and the coordination of parts.”</p>

<p>Balzac, the greatest novelist that France has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
produced, similarly exemplifies the laborious industry
of the man of genius in providing his subconsciousness
with material for future use, and training
it to respond more fully to the demands of the upper
consciousness. It was Balzac’s habit to wander for
days among the people, inquiring into their customs,
manners, motives, and ways of thinking; and he would
travel a hundred miles to get the data for a few lines
of description. The result, when his genius began to
show itself, after a long and painful period of incubation,
was the creation of a series of works that will be
read and reread as long as books are printed.</p>

<p>Of Dante, Boccaccio tells us that “taken by the
sweetness of knowing the truth of the things concealed
in Heaven, and finding no other pleasure dearer
to him in life, he left all other worldly care and gave
himself to this alone; and, that no part of philosophy
might remain unseen by him, he plunged with acute
intellect into the deepest recesses of theology, and so
far succeeded in his design that, caring nothing for
heat or cold, or watchings or fastings, or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
bodily discomforts, by assiduous study he came to
know of the divine essence and of the other separate
intelligences that the human intellect can comprehend.”</p>

<p>Napoleon is known to have occupied his mind
almost incessantly with problems of military strategy.
Even at the opera he would forget the music in wrestling
with such questions as, “I have ten thousand
men at Strassburg, fifteen thousand at Magdeburg,
twenty thousand at Würzburg. By what stages must
they march so as to reach Ratisbon on three successive
days?” Mozart, on the contrary, thought,
lived, and moved in an atmosphere of music. He
could not so much as go for a walk or play a game
of billiards without humming to himself over and over
again airs that he was striving to develop to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” he once declared, “takes so much pains
in the study of composition as I. You could not
easily name a famous master in music whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
not industriously studied, often going through his
works several times.”</p>

<p>Schiller, even as a boy, “felt that without diligence
no mastery can be won.” Halley once asked
Newton how he had made his marvellous discoveries
in the physical realm. “By always thinking about
them,” was his reply. Thus the record might be continued
down to the Edisons and Bergsons and Debussys
of to-day.</p>

<p>Quite evidently, what happens is that the perpetual
concentration of attention on some one problem
or set of problems, not merely deposits in the subconscious
an exceptional wealth of material, but also
favours the emergence of the results of its manipulation
of that material. Just as, in the case of the
ordinary man, it is only when he is intensely interested
in, say, the detection of an error in book-keeping,
that he is likely to have the cause of that error
made plain to him by a sudden “happy thought,” or
through the medium of a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>It may, then, be stated as a well-established fact
that intense interest plus persistent effort is the
prime essential to the highest success in any sphere
of human activity. Of importance, also, is the fact
that, as a general thing, the “set” of a man’s mind,
the direction which his interest most readily takes, is
indicated more or less clearly in the first years of life.
This is proved not only by the early lives of the
world’s most eminent men and women, but also by the
results of careful statistical investigations into the
life histories of “average” people. Especially impressive
are the findings of an inquiry carried out not
long ago by that well-known American psychologist,
Edward L. Thorndike, and reported by him in <cite>The
Popular Science Monthly</cite>, vol. lxxxi (1912).</p>

<p>Professor Thorndike submitted to one hundred
third year students in Columbia College, Barnard
College, and Teachers’ College, New York, a list of
subjects of study, including mathematics, history,
literature, science, drawing, and such hand-work as
carving, carpentering, gardening, etc. Each stu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>dent
was required to fill in a tabular blank showing
the order in which the various subjects were of greatest
interest to that particular student: (1) during
the last three years of elementary school attendance,
(2) during the high school period, and (3) at the
time of the investigation. Blanks were also to be
filled indicating the student’s judgment as to his or
her ability in each of the respective subjects during
the period covered by the inquiry.</p>

<p>From the statistics thus gathered two things stood
out clearly. No fewer than 60 per cent. of the students
made returns showing that the subjects which
appealed to them most strongly in their college work
were the subjects that had most interested them in
early life; and an even closer correspondence (65
per cent.) was shown between intensity of interest
and intellectual ability. Professor Thorndike then
extended his investigation to include two hundred
other individuals, and obtained virtually the same results.</p>

<p>“These facts,” it is not surprising to find him say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>ing
in comment, “unanimously witness to the importance
of early interests. They are shown to be far
from fickle and evanescent.... It would indeed be
hard to find any feature of a human being which
was a more permanent fact of his nature than his
relative degree of interest in different lines of thought
and action.”</p>

<p>What this means, unquestionably, is that every
parent, in planning the education of his children or
in assisting them to choose a vocation, should make
a real effort to gain some insight into their special
interests. Not only so, but there is reason for adding
that he should also endeavour to ascertain and
cultivate those interests while his children are still
quite young. Otherwise he is likely to find them growing
to manhood and womanhood—as, under present
conditions, most children do grow—with the strongest
of their “worth while” interests so attenuated
that really effective mental effort is next to impossible.
In these circumstances—unless they chance,
as Charles Darwin did, to come under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of a personality able to rouse their dormant powers
into exceptional activity—the likelihood is that
they will achieve only mediocre results, muddling
along through life even when they happen to hit on
vocations truly suited to them.</p>

<p>Are we to infer that children, at a tender age,
should be encouraged to think seriously about serious
subjects? Assuredly, provided the subjects be
made sufficiently interesting to them. It is not without
significance that a large majority of men of
genius have been distinguished for their precocity;
or, if not precocious in the ordinary sense of the
term, they have busied themselves in childhood with
mental activities allied to those for which they afterward
attained eminence.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s interest in military problems dates
from his boyhood. Lord Kelvin, the foremost physicist
of the nineteenth century, was making electrical
machines when only nine years old, and played with
them as other children play with dolls and marbles.
Thomas Hobbes translated the “Medea” of Euripi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>des
into Latin iambic verse before he was fourteen.
Cicero at thirteen is credited with having written a
treatise on the art of oratory. Fénelon preached his
first sermon when only fifteen years old. Grotius
at the age of fourteen was widely known for his
learning. Hallam, the famous historian, could read
well before he was five, and had turned author four
years later. Galileo, like Lord Kelvin, constructed
mechanical toys in his childhood.</p>

<p>Not to accumulate instances tediously, it need only
be added that, in making a survey of the biographies
of a thousand eminent British men and women, the
English psychologist, Havelock Ellis, found that
only forty-four were specifically mentioned as not
having been precocious, while nearly three hundred
were mentioned as having been distinctly precocious
in one sense or another. Even in the case of the
forty-four, Mr. Ellis discovered, several were really
as precocious as any of the three hundred, being
“already absorbed in their own lines of mental activity.”
To this class belong, for example, Landor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Byron, and Wiseman, the last of whom is described
as having been in boyhood, “dull and stupid, always
reading and thinking.” Nor, according to the results
of Mr. Ellis’s investigation, did precocity have
any unfavourable effect on the health of these men
and women of genius.</p>

<p>All similar investigations, in fact, go to show that
intellectual activity makes for longevity—that
those who think hardest are likely to live longest.
Of one group of nearly eight hundred and fifty men
of genius it was found that only two hundred and
fifty died before they were sixty years old, while one
hundred and thirty-one lived to be eighty or older.
For another group of five hundred, an average life-span
of nearly sixty-five years was found, as against
a life-span of fifty-one years for all classes of people
who pass the age of twenty. In the case of still
another group, studied by a third investigator, an
average of seventy-one years was established.</p>

<p>What gives these figures greater significance is
the fact that in many instances the man of genius is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
exceptionally frail in early life. Mr. Ellis, in his
statistical study, found that more than two hundred—or
more than 20 per cent. of the eminent men and
women included in his survey—were “congenitally
of a notably feeble constitution,” yet that among
these were some of the longest lived. How is this to
be explained? Only on the theory that the joy they
felt in doing work congenial to them promoted bodily
as well as mental vigour. And, in point of fact, it
is to-day a commonplace among psychologists that
pleasurable emotions make for increased strength,
while disagreeable feelings make for weakness.</p>

<p>Viewed from whatever angle, therefore, “being interested”
is one of the most important things in the
world to every one of us. The earlier we become interested—intensely
interested—in some specific
field of activity, the brighter our future prospects
will be.</p>

<p>But—this is the crucial question in the present
connection—is the awaking of a lively interest, an
interest so intense that it spurs to incessant en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>deavour
in some special field, sufficient to account for
the achievements of the man of genius? Granting
that the man of genius depends for his results, as I
have tried to show, on the extent to which he upbuilds
and stimulates his subconscious powers by
conscious observation and thought, must we not assume
that he possesses, to begin with, an exceptional
mental capacity? Or is favouring circumstance in
his environment—the occurrence of events that
make so profound an impression on his mind as to
arouse a fervent longing for accomplishment—sufficient
to explain him? In short, would it be possible,
by careful education and the wise adjustment of
environmental influences, so to develop any individual
of normal mentality that he might achieve in his
chosen life-work results usually regarded as bearing
the stamp of genius?</p>

<p>Such, decidedly, is my belief. I base it partly on
the repeated failure of investigators to demonstrate
the operation of heredity in the making of the vast
multitude of men of genius who, in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
mankind, have sprung from all sorts and conditions
of ancestors, rich and poor, proud and humble, wise
and ignorant. Partly I base it on the many instances
in which men of genius have themselves been
able to trace the determination of their activities to
fortunate happenings in early life. But most of all
I base it on certain experiments in education undertaken
by parents entirely unaware of the interrelationship
between conscious thinking and subconscious
“inspiration,” yet intuitively believing that
the sooner a child is habituated to using his mind to
good purpose the more he will accomplish in later life.</p>

INTENSIVE CHILD CULTURE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he student body of Harvard University
at present includes three youths whose remarkable
intellectual achievements and
the manner of their upbringing have given rise to
much discussion in American educational circles.
The oldest of these students was graduated from
Tufts College at the age of fourteen, gained the degree
of Ph.D. at Harvard when only eighteen, and
now is continuing his studies abroad as the holder
of a Harvard travelling fellowship. The youngest
of the trio became a special student at Harvard before
he was twelve, was graduated with honours when
scarcely sixteen, and is at present engaged in post-graduate
studies. The third passed the regular
Harvard entrance examinations when less than four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>teen,
completed his college course with distinction in
three years, and to-day is studying law.</p>

<p>What has excited controversial interest in these
youths is not so much their precocity, striking
though that is, as the fact that in each case they
have been educated along novel lines from their
earliest childhood. Their fathers, who have worked
independently of one another, assert, indeed, that
their unusual mental development is not due to any
exceptional talent, but is the result of the peculiar
home training they have received; the implication
being that a similar development is possible to every
normal child if reared in the same way. Besides
which, the fathers contend that the prevailing method
of giving children little or no formal education until
they are old enough to go to school is fundamentally
wrong; that the home is the proper place in which
to begin a child’s education, and that the proper time
to begin is with the first dawning of the child’s ability
and desire to use his reasoning powers. Or, as one
of them has recently declared:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>“In the large majority of children the beginning
of education should be between the second and third
year. It is at that time that the child begins to
form his interests. It is at that critical period that
we have to seize the opportunity to guide the child’s
formative energies in the right channels. To delay
is a mistake and a wrong to the child. We can
at that early period awaken a love of knowledge which
will persist through life. The child will as eagerly
play in the game of knowledge as he now spends the
most of his energies in meaningless games and objectless,
silly sports.” (Boris Sidis’s “Philistine
and Genius,” pp. 67–68.)</p>

<p>Some few educators in this country have already
tentatively approved the new ideas in child-training
as exemplified by the methods pursued and the results
obtained in the case of these youthful Harvard
students. For the most part, however, their promulgation
has been greeted skeptically, even with caustic
criticism. On the one hand, it is alleged that the
parents cannot positively prove that the achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>ments
of their boys are not the result of inherited
gifts rather than the special education given them;
and, on the other hand, the position is taken that,
assuming the correctness of their fathers’ contention
in this respect, it is by no means evident that such
training is desirable.</p>

<p>In the words of one critic, to begin the education
of a child at two or three is to rob that child of his
childhood. The training in question is described as
a “forcing” system, much talk is heard of “mind
strain,” and the prediction is freely made that the
ultimate outcome can only be to drive children thus
educated into an asylum for the insane, or into an
early grave.</p>

<p>My own belief is that the critics are wrong. I
have long been acquainted with all three of these
students, and in one case have had opportunity to
observe rather closely the process of mental and
physical development for upward of eight years.
All three are sturdy, strong young fellows; if anything
above the average for their years in stature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and weight. Time alone, of course, can tell whether
they will live to a good old age. But if they should
die or become insane, I am satisfied that neither misfortune
could justly be attributed to their parents’
educational methods. On the contrary, the principles
underlying these methods seem to me for the
most part so beneficial that I believe the time will
come when they will be quite generally adopted.</p>

<p>Decidedly, though, I should not express myself with
such assurance were it not for the fact that these
same principles have long ago been put to the test and
impressively vindicated. I wonder if the name of
James Thomson of Annaghmore has ever been heard
by those who have so hastily condemned the parents
of the three Harvard students? Doubtless not, else
they would surely have moderated their denunciations.</p>

<p>Thomson, who was born in the year 1786, the son
of a Scotch-Irish farmer, was pre-eminently a “self-made”
man. Seemingly doomed to the obscure existence
of an ordinary farm-labourer, he had eman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>cipated
himself by dint of an extraordinary energy.
With but slight aid he contrived, while a mere child,
to teach himself to read, write, and cipher. In the
fields, and by candle-light in his farm home, at every
opportunity, he studied little text-books that were
to him the most fascinating things in the world because
they gave him knowledge. He was determined
to become an educated man, and continually he
urged his father to let him go to school.</p>

<p>To school eventually he went, in the neighbouring
village of Ballykine, and there, as in his childhood,
he found his greatest delight in the study of mathematics.
He must, he told himself, know more about
this great science; he must know everything that
could be learned about it. Also, being of a religious
turn of mind, he planned to fit himself to become
a clergyman. Obviously, whether to learn higher
mathematics, or to qualify for the ministry, it was
necessary to go to college. And to college he did
go; but, so difficult were his circumstances, not until
he was a man full-grown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>From 1810 to 1814—that is, from the age of
twenty-four to twenty-eight—he spent six months
of every year at the University of Glasgow. The
other six months he spent earning his living.
Finally he received the coveted M.A. degree, and
having in the meantime become more enamoured of
mathematics than of a clerical career, he accepted
appointment to the teaching staff of an academy in
Belfast, where, married to a sweetheart of his Glasgow
days, he soon entered upon the additional task
of bringing up a family.</p>

<p>It is at this point that he becomes of special interest
to us. For, looking back at the stupendous
obstacles he himself had had to overcome in gaining
an education, he resolved to do everything in his
power to make the road to learning easy for his children.</p>

<p>To do this, it seemed to him, the proper course
to pursue was to begin their education as soon as
they showed an intelligent interest in the world about
them. For, he argued, quite in the manner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
fathers of the three Harvard students of to-day, it
is because the education of children begins too late
that they find it hard to learn, and strain their minds
in the attainment of knowledge. Let a child get accustomed
to using his mind to good purpose in early
childhood, and study will never be a tax on him but
a perpetual joy. This, thought he, is the way all
children should be brought up.</p>

<p>And, with the faithful co-operation of his wife,
this was the way James Thomson brought up his own
children. He taught them, boys and girls, to spell
and to read almost as soon as they could speak. He
taught them mathematics, history, geography, and
the elements of natural science. One of the busiest
of men—for he was a writer of mathematical textbooks
as well as a classroom instructor—he made
great sacrifices for the sake of their education. He
would even get up at four in the morning to work
on his text-books and to prepare his lectures, so as
to be sure of having freedom to instruct his little
ones during the day. Especially he made it a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to fertilise their minds, to whet their interest in
worth while things, in the course of table-talk and
when out walking with them.</p>

<p>“When spring came,” one of his daughters, Mrs.
Elizabeth King, has recalled in a delightful volume
of family reminiscences, “our father generally took
a walk with us in the early morning before breakfast,
and he used to invent interesting topics of conversation,
which were carried on through successive
mornings. Two of us held his hands and two walked
quite near, but the places of honour were shared alternately
by the four. I remember all being intensely
interested in a series of talks on the progress
of civilisation, in which every one, even little
Willie, suggested ideas, and took part in the conversation.</p>

<p>“We also in these walks made imaginary voyages
of discovery, full of adventure, calling at various
ports, and sailing up rivers to obtain the products
of the countries we visited, and become acquainted
with the inhabitants. We explored the icy regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of the north, the burning deserts of Africa and
Arabia, and the fragrant forests of Ceylon. There
was no end to our travels and the wonders we saw
when we walked with our father. Sometimes we
transported ourselves to ancient days, and sailed
with the Argonauts in search of the golden fleece,
or accompanied the Greeks to Troy to recover the
beautiful Helen, or joined Ulysses in his protracted
wanderings. Our father always led the talk, but we
all assisted.”</p>

<p>His two older sons, James and William, were the
special objects of his care, particularly after their
mother’s death, which occurred when James was
eight and William six. After this sad event he lived
more than ever with these two boys, giving up part
of his bedroom to them, and diligently drilling them
in the rudiments of an all-round education. When,
in 1832, he was appointed professor of mathematics
at his old university, he continued their home training,
and in addition obtained permission for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
attend his university lectures and the lectures of some
other professors.</p>

<p>Two years later, James being then twelve and William
ten, they were admitted as full-fledged undergraduates.
And, precocious though they were, they
also were healthy, vigorous, active boys, full of fun
and eager to romp and play. Like other boys they
delighted in games and toys, with the sole difference
that in many instances their toys were scientific
instruments. Thus, they made with their own
hands little electrical machines with which to give
harmless and laughter-provoking shocks to their
friends.</p>

<p>In a word, all who knew them liked them—and
marvelled at them. There was abundant cause for
marvel. Not only did they keep up with their studies
with ease, but in more than one department of knowledge
they outdid their classmates, some of whom
were well into their twenties. The following excerpt
from “The Book of the Jubilee” gives a vivid idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of the scholastic achievements of these two remarkable
boys in the first years of their life at Glasgow
University:</p>

<p>“At the end of his first winter’s work William
Thomson carried off two prizes in the Humanity
Class; this before he was eleven. In the next session
we follow him to the classes of Natural History and
Greek—we wonder what the present occupants of
these chairs would say to a stripling under twelve
who presented himself at their lectures—and his
name figures in both prize-lists.</p>

<p>“Sympathy is not lacking for the hard-worked
school-boy of to-day; but what would the child of
twelve think of the holiday task of translating Lucian’s
‘Dialogues of the Gods,’ with full parsing of
the first three dialogues! This is the piece of work
for which William Thomson, Glasgow College, receives
a prize in May, 1836.</p>

<p>“Next session we find the two brothers together
in the Junior Mathematical Class, of the Junior Division
of which they are first and second prize-men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
They appear again at the head of the list for the
Monthly Voluntary Examinations on the work of the
class and its applications. Proceeding to the Senior
Mathematical Class in 1837–38, they again stand at
the top, nor have they failed to present themselves
for the Voluntary Examinations. William is not
satisfied with this class, but in addition receives the
second prize in the Junior Division of Professor
Robert Buchanan’s Logic Class.”</p>

<p>And, continuing to win laurels, at the close of the
next session they took the first and second places as
prize-men in natural philosophy, while William the
following year gained the class prize in astronomy,
and was awarded a university medal for an essay,
“On the Figure of the Earth,” the manuscript of
which, a carefully bound volume of eighty-five pages,
is still in existence. He was then not sixteen years
old.</p>

<p>Of course there were not lacking wiseacres who
dolefully predicted all manner of unpleasant things
for these “unhappy victims of a father’s folly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>”
who must inevitably fade into an early grave. But
the father only smiled serenely, confident that the
future would vindicate his educational innovation.
And, of a surety, the future did. For James Thomson,
the older of the two, living to the age of
seventy, left behind him the reputation of one of
England’s leading authorities on engineering; while
William, who did not die until he was eighty-three,
became even more famous, winning, as Lord Kelvin
of Largs, a place in the annals of science fairly comparable
with that held by the immortal Newton.</p>

<p>A similar process of intensive child culture was
carried out, with similarly happy results, in the
case of John Stuart Mill, whose father modelled his
whole upbringing in accordance with the theory that
the mind, like the body, grows with exercise, and
that the sooner the process of exercising and training
it begins, the better the child’s prospects for a
worthy and efficient manhood. Like James Thomson
the elder Mill was an exceedingly busy man, but
this did not prevent him from making the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
development of his son a matter of patient, personal
attention. Almost as soon as the little John could
talk, his formal education began, and throughout his
childhood was continued along lines that have provoked
indignant comment in many quarters.</p>

<p>“I have no remembrance,” he tells us, in his interesting
“Autobiography,” “of the time when I
began to learn Greek. I have been told that it was
when I was three years old. My earliest recollection
on the subject is that of committing to memory what
my father termed vocables, being lists of common
Greek words, with their signification in English,
which he wrote out for me on cards. Of grammar,
until some years later, I learned no more than the
inflexions of the nouns and verbs, but after a course
of vocables, proceeded at once to translation; and I
faintly remember going through ‘Æsop’s Fables,’
the first Greek book which I read. The ‘Anabasis,’
which I remember better, was the second. I learned
no Latin until my eighth year.</p>

<p>“At that time I had read, under my father’s tui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>tion,
a number of Greek prose authors, among whom
I remember the whole of Herodotus, and of Xenophon’s
‘Cyropaedia’ and ‘Memorials of Socrates’;
some of the lives of the philosophers by Diogenes
Laertius; part of Lucian; and ‘Isocrates ad
Demonicum’ and ‘Ad Nicoclem.’... What he himself
was willing to undergo for the sake of my instruction,
may be judged from the fact that I went
through the whole process of preparing my Greek
lessons in the same room and at the same table at
which he was writing; and as in those days Greek and
English lexicons were not, and I could make no more
use of a Greek and Latin lexicon than could be made
without having yet begun to learn Latin, I was forced
to have recourse to him for the meaning of every
word which I did not know. This incessant interruption
he, one of the most impatient of men, submitted
to, and wrote under that interruption several volumes
of his history and all else that he had to write during
those years.</p>

<p>“The only thing besides Greek that I learned as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
lesson in this part of my childhood was arithmetic;
this also my father taught me. It was the task of
the evenings, and I well remember its disagreeableness.
But the lessons were only a part of the daily
instruction I received. Much of it consisted in the
books I read by myself, and my father’s discourses to
me, chiefly during our walks.</p>

<p>“From 1810 to 1813 (that is, from Mill’s fourth
to eighth year) we were living in Kensington Green,
then an almost rustic neighbourhood. My father’s
health required considerable and constant exercise,
and he walked habitually before breakfast, generally
in the green lanes toward Hornsey. In these walks
I always accompanied him, and with my earliest recollections
of green fields and wild-flowers, is mingled
that of the account I gave him daily of what I had
read the day before. To the best of my remembrance,
this was a voluntary rather than a prescribed
exercise. I made notes on slips of paper while reading,
and from these in the morning walks I told the
story to him....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>“In these frequent talks about the books I read,
he used, as opportunity offered, to give me explanations
and ideas respecting civilisation, government,
morality, mental cultivation, which he required me
afterward to restate to him in my own words....
He was fond of putting into my hands books which
exhibited men of energy and resource in unusual circumstances,
struggling against difficulties and overcoming
them: of such works I remember Beaver’s
‘African Memoranda,’ and Collins’s ‘Account of the
First Settlement of New South Wales.’... Of
children’s books, any more than of playthings, I had
scarcely any, except an occasional gift from a relation
or acquaintance: among those I had, ‘Robinson Crusoe’
was pre-eminent, and continued to delight me
through all my boyhood.</p>

<p>“It was no part, however, of my father’s system
to exclude books of amusement, though he allowed
them very sparingly. Of such books he possessed at
that time next to none, but he borrowed several for
me; those which I remember are the ‘Arabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Nights,’ Cazotte’s ‘Arabian Tales,’ ‘Don Quixote,’
Miss Edgeworth’s ‘Popular Tales,’ and a book of
some reputation in its day, Brooke’s ‘Fool of Quality.’”</p>

<p>In one respect, it must be conceded, Mill’s early
education was deficient—it depended altogether too
much on the knowledge to be gained from books, and
not enough on direct study of the laws and beauties
of Nature. But against this stands the unquestionable
fact that it did establish in him lifelong habits
of industry and thoroughness, and an abiding joy
in intellectual achievement; and, more important, it
had the happy result of habituating him to regard
himself as consecrated to a life of labour for the public
good. As to the “wrong” done to Mill by “robbing him of the
joys of childhood,” one of his biographers, Professor
William Minto, justly observes:</p>

<p>“Much pity has been expressed over the dreary,
cheerless existence that the child must have led, cut
off from all boyish amusements and companionship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
working day after day on his father’s treadmill; but
a childhood and boyhood spent in the enlargement
of knowledge, with the continual satisfaction of difficulties
conquered, buoyed up by day-dreams of emulating
the greatest of human benefactors, need not
have been an unhappy childhood, and Mill expressly
says that his was not unhappy. It seems unhappy
only when we compare it with the desires of childhood
left more to itself, and when we decline to imagine
its peculiar enjoyments and aspirations. Mill
complains that his father often required more than
could be reasonably expected of him, but his tasks
were not so severe as to prevent him from growing
up a healthy, hardy, and high-spirited boy, though
he was not constitutionally robust, and his tastes and
pursuits were so different from those of other boys
of the same age.”</p>

<p>Mill was never a college student, and was for the
most part self-educated after his sixteenth year. But
had he been sent to college at an early age, as his
home training amply warranted, there is every rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>son
to think he would have acquitted himself as brilliantly
as did the Thomson boys, and as did Karl
Witte, another noteworthy example of the possibilities
open to all parents. Indeed, Witte’s case is in
some respects the most interesting and instructive on
record. For one thing his father has left a minutely
detailed account of the methods employed in his education;
and there is ground to suspect that at the
outset of life Karl Witte was below rather than above
the average in mentality.</p>

<p>Born in July, 1800, in the German village of
Lochau, near Halle, he was the son of a country
clergyman, likewise named Karl Witte, who had long
been regarded as somewhat “eccentric.” In especial
the elder Witte was known to hold “peculiar”
views on education. It was his firm belief, just as it
was the belief of James Thomson and James Mill,
that only by beginning the educational process in
infancy could one make sure of developing children
into really rational men and women. Looking at
the world about him, and noting the extent to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
people wasted their lives in hopeless inefficiency and
reckless dissipation, he said to himself, in effect:</p>

<p>“These poor people do not reason, do not use
their God-given intellects. If they did they would
conduct themselves altogether differently. The
trouble must be that they have not been educated
aright. They have not been taught how to think,
and what to think about. They have been started
wrong in life. The schools and universities are to
blame, but far more their parents are to blame. If
love of the good, the beautiful, and the true had
been implanted in them in youth, if they had been
trained from the first in the proper use of their minds,
they would not now be living so foolishly.”</p>

<p>Holding these views, Pastor Witte promised himself
that if God blessed him with children he would
make their education his special care. His first child,
however, died in early infancy. Then came Karl, at
birth so unprepossessing and “stupid” in appearance
that his father wondered in what way he had
offended God that he should be afflicted with a wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>less
child. The neighbours, sympathising, held out
what hopes they could, but secretly agreed that Pastor
Witte’s boy was undoubtedly an idiot.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood until one day the father fancied
that he detected in the child signs of intelligence.
There and then he set about “making a man of him,”
as he expressed it. He began, even before Karl could
speak, by naming to him different parts of the human
body, objects in his bedroom, etc. Later, as soon
as the child was old enough to toddle about, he gradually
broadened the horizon of his knowledge, taking
him for walks through the streets and fields of Lochau,
and calling his attention to all sorts of interesting
things. Encouraging him to ask questions he
went in his replies as fully as possible into the essential
details of the subject under discussion. Above
all, he avoided giving superficial answers, for it was
his great aim to impress on Karl the importance of
reasoning closely, of appreciating relationships and
dissimilarities. If the child asked him something to
which he could not respond intelligently, he frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
confessed his ignorance, but suggested that by working
together they might obtain a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>Also, in his daily walks and conversations with his
son, “baby talk” had no place. It was part of
Pastor Witte’s theory, as it is part of Doctor
Berle’s to-day, that this mode of addressing children,
however it may appeal to the sentimental side of
fathers and mothers, is intellectually enervating to
their little ones. The child who would think correctly,
he argued, must be taught to speak correctly.</p>

<p>For this reason he not only drilled Karl in the correct
pronunciation and use of words, but insisted that
all who talked with the child should be careful how
they spoke to him. Besides which, with an intuitive
appreciation of the formative value of even the seemingly
most trivial details of the home environment,
he arranged the household furnishings so that they
too, by the subtle influence of suggestion, should contribute
powerfully to Karl’s development. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
tells us in his own account, of which an abridged
translation into English has recently been made by
Professor Leo Wiener, of Harvard University:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>“I tolerated as far as possible nothing in my
house, yard, garden, etc., that was not tasteful, especially
nothing that did not harmonise with its surroundings.
If anything was not harmonious, I was
uneasy about it until it was removed. All my rooms
were papered with wall-paper of one colour, the fields
being surrounded by pleasing borders. In every
room there was but little furniture, but such as there
was, was carefully selected. On all the walls hung
paintings or etchings, but none of these was tastelessly
glaring in colours, or represented an unpleasant
subject. Our yard and garden were in bloom from
earliest Spring to very late in the Fall. Snowbells
and crocuses started the procession, and winter asters
were crushed only by the snow or a severe frost. We
ourselves were always dressed cleanly but simply.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>
<p>At first, it must be said, Karl’s mother had scant
sympathy with her husband’s enthusiasm. She felt
that he was mistaken, that the child was “too stupid”
to be educated, and that nothing would come of the
pains taken with him. This was the general belief
of the neighbourhood, but it gave place to a feeling
of astonished incredulity upon the discovery that in
reality the youngster was making extraordinary
progress, and was displaying not only intelligence but
a love of knowledge rarely seen in boys of any age.
Before he was six all who talked with him were amazed
at the proofs he gave of the great extent to which he
had profited from his early training.</p>

<p>Most impressive was the accuracy and fulness of
the information he even then possessed regarding a
variety of subjects, and his linguistic proficiency.
His study of foreign languages began with French,
while he still was very young, and was conducted in
a novel way, his father giving him French translations
of books with which he was already familiar in
German, and telling him to read them for a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
time each day. No attempt was made to teach him
the grammar of the language as it is commonly
taught in the schools, his father’s belief being that
the boy could best pick up the grammar for himself
in the course of his reading, and that he would be
able to master the French translations with comparatively
little trouble by reason of his previous training
in the art of observation, analysis, and synthesis.
This expectation was realised so fully that, according
to his father’s statement, Karl within a year was
reading French with ease.</p>

<p>Meantime he had begun the study of Italian, and
from Italian passed to Latin. Chance played some
part in introducing him to this language. His father
had taken him to a concert in Leipzig, and during an
intermission handed him the libretto. He looked at
it casually, then with some intentness, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, father, this is not French, nor is it Italian.
It must be Latin!”</p>

<p>“Let it be what it may,” said Witte, “if only you
can make out what it means. Try at least.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>The boy, already grounded in two languages derived
from Latin, puzzled out the meaning with considerable
success, and declared enthusiastically:</p>

<p>“Father, if Latin is such an easy language as this,
I should like to learn it.”</p>

<p>English came next, and then the study of Greek,
a language regarding which the boy’s curiosity was
whetted by tales from Homer and Xenophon told to
him by his father. Again the process was chiefly
one of self-education, the father answering—when
he could—the questions put to him by Karl, but
always insisting to the latter that the proper way to
learn anything is to overcome its difficulties for
oneself. He was now studying and reading French,
Italian, Latin, English, and Greek, in all of which he
made such progress that, we are told, by the time he
was nine he had read Homer, Plutarch, Virgil, Cicero,
Fénelon, Florian, and Metastasio in the original, besides
Schiller and other classical German writers.</p>

<p>Naturally the fame of the boy spread abroad, and
with its spreading his father came in for some sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
criticism. Formerly he had been laughed at as a
man who was essaying the impossible in striving to
impart intelligence to a mentally subnormal child.
Now that he had succeeded so well in his undertaking
people asserted that he was fanatically endeavouring
to convert the child into a weird thinking machine,
and endangering his health and sanity. Precisely
the same objections, in short, were raised to
his educational experiment that were later raised in
the case of the Thomson boys and John Stuart Mill,
and that have recently been raised against the educational
methods of the fathers of the three youths now
in Harvard.</p>

<p>All kinds of absurd stories were circulated regarding
Karl. He was pictured quite generally as a
pale, anæmic, puny, goggle-eyed “freak,” who had
missed the delights of childhood and was vastly to
be pitied. In reality, he was a happy, joyous
youngster, who got as much “fun” out of life as any
boy could. This is the unanimous testimony of those
who “investigated” the lad for themselves. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the archæologist Heyne, in a statement to his friend
the famous philosopher and poet Wieland, frankly
admitted:</p>

<p>“I allowed myself to be persuaded to examine
young Witte, in order to be able to form my own
opinion of him. I found the boy in body and mind
happy and hale to a greater degree than I had expected.
I found, in testing him with Homer and
Virgil, that he had sufficient knowledge of words and
things to translate readily and strike the right meaning,
and that, without exact grammatical and lingual
knowledge, he was able to guess correctly the meaning
of a passage from its context. What was most
remarkable to me was that he read with understanding,
feeling, and effect.</p>

<p>“Otherwise I found in him no preponderating faculty.
Memory, imagination, reasoning, were about in
equilibrium. In other matters besides those that
had been inculcated by education, I found him a
happy, lusty boy, not even averse from mischief,
which was to me a quieting thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time that he was thus instructing
Karl in languages and literature, Witte sought to
awaken in him a love of art and science. Neither
artist nor scientist himself, he none the less believed
that if he could only interest his son sufficiently in
artistic and scientific subjects, he would study them
enthusiastically. To this end he adopted a plan
which might well be imitated by all parents.</p>

<p>Whenever he went to Halle, Leipzig, or any other
German city, he took Karl with him, and together
they visited art galleries, natural history museums,
zoölogical and botanical gardens, and manufacturing
establishments. Not for a moment, however, did he
hint to the boy that he was doing this for educational
purposes. When, for example, they visited a factory,
he did not say, “I have brought you here to
give you a lesson in mechanics.” He allowed the
boy to think that he simply wished to entertain him;
and in this way, without Karl’s suspecting it, he was
able to impart to him much elementary instruction
in zoölogy, botany, physics, chemistry, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly he taught Karl geography by the pleasing
device of first taking him, on a clear day, to the
top of a high tower that happened to be in Lochau,
and asking him to mark on a piece of paper, brought
to the tower for that purpose, the position of the
different villages visible in the surrounding country.
This first trip was followed by others, in which the
boy expanded and corrected the markings on his
paper, putting in rivers, lakes, and forests. Witte
then bought for him a set of maps showing, in succession,
the part of Germany in which he lived, all
Germany, Europe, and the other continents. These
father and son studied together, not as a study, but
as a game, in which the boy took part with the greatest
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I never acted,” Witte himself has declared, “as
though he had to learn these things. He would have
been surprised if told that he had been studying
geography, physics, chemistry. I avoided the mention
of such terms, so as not to frighten him, and in
order not to make him vain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>Not to make him vain! Be sure, indeed, that Pastor
Witte, while promoting his son’s mental development,
would not forget to ground him in moral principles.
He was not, let it be clearly understood,
striving to make an intellectual “prodigy” of his
son; he was aiming only to make him a man in the
truest sense, strong physically and morally as well as
mentally. If he believed that the boy’s reasoning
powers could not be properly developed unless he
were trained from infancy in the principles of sound
reasoning, he was quite as firmly convinced that the
process of moral education should likewise begin at
the earliest possible moment. To this end, believing
as he did in the importance of early environmental
influences and of parental example, he endeavoured
to secure for his son wholly ennobling surroundings.</p>

<p>He even laid down rules to be observed by the
maid-of-all-work, a simple but good-hearted peasant
girl, in her dealings with the child. The whole family
life was regulated with a view to “suggesting” to
the little Karl ideas which, sinking into the subcon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>scious
region of his mind, would tend to affect favourably
his moral outlook and exercise a lasting influence
on his conduct. In their relations with all who
visited their home—as with each other, with Karl
himself, and with the little serving-maid—both Pastor
Witte and his wife were unfailingly courteous,
considerate, and sympathetic. Over and above all
this, they set him a constant example in diligence, of
that earnest activity which is itself a powerful factor
in moral discipline.</p>

<p>Important also is it to note that in their daily
walks and talks together, Karl’s father took good
care to cultivate in him the gift of imagination, which
means so much to the moral as well as the mental
growth of man. When they went hand in hand across
the fields of Lochau, it was not only in rudiments of
science that Witte instructed his son; he deftly awakened
in him an appreciation of the sublimity and
beauty in the workings of Nature. When he narrated
to him stories from history, it was not merely to
interest him in the study of history; the emphasis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
was on some moral trait exemplified by the particular
story. In familiarising him with the life of Lochau
itself, in introducing him to its shops and cottage-homes,
the effort was tactfully made to awaken
and broaden his sympathies. Always it was one of
Witte’s chief objects to keep his son as free as possible
from anything that might make for harshness,
narrowness, and intolerance in later years.</p>

<p>Even when Karl was not more than three or four
years old, his father did not deem it too early to attempt
by rebuke and admonition to instil into him
the idea that he ought to guard his tongue closely
to avoid hurting the feelings of other people. All
children, as is well known, are inclined to “speak out
in meeting,” and frequently their “cute” comments,
which many parents applaud as evidences of keen observational
power, convey a sting to the person commented
on. So soon as this universal trait of childhood
appeared in little Karl his father set about suppressing
it, and at the same time sought to utilise
it as an aid in his moral education. The occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
arose following a thoughtless remark by the child
regarding some slight eccentricity in the behaviour
of a certain Herr N., a friend of the family. When
father and son were alone, the former asked:</p>

<p>“Why did you speak of Herr N. as you did?”</p>

<p>“Because what I said was true.”</p>

<p>“I grant that. It was true—it was, indeed, very
true. But that is no reason you should have said it.
It was neither good nor kind of you. Did you not
see how disturbed he became? He would say nothing
back, perhaps because of the love he bears for us.
But it pained him very much that a child should say
anything so unpleasant to him. If he is unhappy to-day,
the fault is yours.”</p>

<p>Witte tells us that it was not long before Karl
acquired the excellent habit of “putting himself in
the other fellow’s place” before uttering censorious
judgments. Similarly, and with equal success, his
father endeavoured to broaden his sympathies so as
to include the brute creation. It happened one day,
when Karl was about three years old, that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
at his home a number of guests, who made much of
the child, naturally to his great delight. While they
were talking to him the family dog came into the
room, and Karl, as any child might, playfully caught
it by the tail and drew it to him. As he did so, his
father, putting out his hand, caught Karl himself
by his long hair and pulled it exactly as he was pulling
the tail of the dog. Karl turned, saw his father’s
indignant look, blushed crimson, and released the
dog.</p>

<p>At once his father released him, and demanded:</p>

<p>“How did you like that?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was the embarrassed answer.</p>

<p>“Well, then, do you think the dog liked it? Now
go out to the yard.”</p>

<p>“I sent him out,” Witte says, “not only as a punishment,
but because I saw that some of my guests
were about to open their lips to take his part and to
blame me—in his presence!—for my treatment of
him. But one of them, speaking suddenly, said:</p>

<p>“‘God bless you, dear friend. If Karl, as I be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>lieve
he is certain to do, shall grow to be a good man,
he will thank you heartily for this lesson. I wish
to Heaven we thus and always handled our children.
Then they would be sure to learn to treat animals
kindly, and by so much the more to treat their fellow-men
kindly!”</p>

<p>And Witte adds, dryly:</p>

<p>“After this, none of those present thought it well
to say anything in criticism of me.”</p>

<p>He had, in fact, taken precisely the course best
calculated to impress on Karl the vitally important
principle of kindness to all living creatures. For he
had brought this principle home to him in a way the
child’s mind could readily grasp, and without unnecessary
harshness and “nagging,” which, after all,
only arouse those contrariant ideas that it should
be the great aim of education to suppress. And it
was thus that Witte and his wife always acted in the
upbringing of their boy through the critical formative
period of early childhood. The moment any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
undesirable characteristic made its appearance they
hastened to awaken in him a sense of its extreme undesirability
by words and conduct that appealed
forcefully both to his understanding and to his emotions.</p>

<p>Particularly did they appeal—and here is a point
deserving of special emphasis—to his sense of filial
love. That they were able to make their appeal unfailingly
successful, that the child always found in
it a compelling motive for good behaviour, was due
to the fact that their whole attitude toward him made
him realise that he was an object of devoted, though
not over-indulgent, love on their part. Never rebuked
without a sufficient cause, and always more in
sorrow than in anger; given a free hand in all things
except those injurious or detrimental to him; made a
companion and a playmate by both parents—he
soon perceived, as any child would, that they had
nothing more warmly at heart than his best interests
and his happiness. Loved as he was, he gave out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
abundant love in return, and the great ambition of
his childhood became a passionate desire to please his
father and mother.</p>

<p>Hence it was that Witte, in carrying out his policy
of early intellectual training, found no more potent
spur to incite his boy to study the subjects given him
than the simple statement, “You know, dear Karl,
you must learn all you can, so that you will be able
to care for your mother and me when we are old and
feeble.” Hence, too, the child acquired habits of
obedience, self-control, and truthfulness, largely because
of his anxiety not to bring pain to his parents.
They, however, it is to be noted, were careful to discipline
him firmly if he did commit a fault, but always
in a way that caused him to appreciate the reasonableness
of the punishment inflicted on him.</p>

<p>Such was the manner of Karl Witte’s education up
to the age of nine. By that time he had learned so
much, and was so well trained in the use of his mental
powers, that his father decided to send him to college.
At nine and a half, to the amazement of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Germany, he entered the University of Leipzig.
There, as at the universities of Göttingen, Giessen,
and Heidelberg, where he also prosecuted his studies,
his career was brilliant in the extreme. No subject—and
he applied himself to many subjects—seemed
beyond his powers. In 1814, before he had passed
his fourteenth birthday, he was granted the degree of
Ph.D. for a thesis on the “Conchoid of Nicomedes,”
a curve of the fourth degree. Two years later he
was made a Doctor of Laws, and appointed to the
teaching staff of the University of Berlin.</p>

<p>Before beginning to teach, however, it was thought
best for him to spend some time in foreign travel,
which he was enabled to do, thanks to the generosity
of no less a personage than the King of Prussia, who
had been following his university career with lively
interest. Abroad, therefore, Karl Witte went,
chiefly to study law, the teaching of which he had
definitely selected as his profession. But toward the
close of 1818 an incident occurred which, while it
did not turn him from law, opened up to him another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
field of intellectual activity, and the one in which he
ultimately won his greatest fame.</p>

<p>While sojourning in Florence he chanced to make
the acquaintance of a talented woman who, discussing
with him the masters of Italian literature, half in
jest and half in earnest warned him not to attempt
to read Dante, whom he could never hope to “understand.”
Naturally this roused his curiosity, and he
promptly bought an elaborate edition of the “Divine
Comedy.” Reading this through, he then read what
the commentators had to say about it, and was
shocked at what he considered the inadequacy and
positive error of their views. “Some day,” said he
to himself, “I will certainly make an effort to promote
a better appreciation of Dante.” This resolution
he carried into effect five years later by the
publication, in Germany, of one of the most important
literary essays of the nineteenth century. It was
entitled “On Misunderstanding Dante,” and concerning
it a modern authority on the study of Dante,
Philip H. Wicksteed, declares:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>“If the history of the revival of interest in Dante
which has characterised this century shall ever be
written, Karl Witte will be the chief hero of the tale.
He was little more than a boy when, in 1823, he entered
the lists against existing Dante scholars, all
and sundry, demonstrated that there was not one of
them that knew his trade, and announced his readiness
to teach it to them. The amazing thing is that
he fully accomplished his vaunt. His essay exercised
a growing influence in Germany, and then in
Europe; and after five-and-forty years of indefatigable
and fruitful toil he was able to look back
upon his youthful attempt as containing the germ of
all his subsequent work on Dante. But now, instead
of the audacious young heretic and revolutionist, he
was the acknowledged master of the most prominent
Dante scholars in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, England,
and America.”</p>

<p>In fact, from the time of the publication of this
preliminary paper, almost to the time of his death,
Dante essays, translations, commentaries, came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the pen of Karl Witte, to delight an ever-widening
circle of Dante scholars, and incidentally to promote
the study of Italian history. To understand Dante,
Witte iterated and reiterated, it is absolutely necessary
to have a knowledge of mediæval Italy. Especially
must one study the religious pre-occupation of
the age, as seen in the rise of Saint Francis and Saint
Dominic, the Thomist reconstitution of theology and
the contemporary consolidation of the hierarchy, and
the attitude of the period toward the Albigenses and
other heretics. This knowledge one must gain if he
would fully appreciate the true significance of the
“Divine Comedy” as the portrayal of man given
over to sin and prevented by his lusts from recovering
the path to virtue, till the Christian religion
teaches him, by the light of understanding, to recognise
sin and free himself from it, and then offers to
his transported vision the divine revelation of the
secret and bliss of Heaven.</p>

<p>Yet all the while the propagation of his views on
Dante and the fostering of a love for Dante were but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
an avocation with Karl Witte. His vocation, his
life-work, was the teaching of the principles of law,
both in the class-room and by the pen. It was in
1821, soon after his return from Italy, that he was
established as lecturer on jurisprudence at the University
of Breslau, being appointed to a full professorship
two years later, and transferred to Halle in
1834. There he passed the remainder of his long
and distinguished life, which did not terminate until
March 6, 1883, when he passed away sincerely
mourned as “a devout Christian and elder of the
church, a scholar overwhelmed with honours and distinctions,
a tender husband and father.”</p>

<p>Thus the “forcing” process to which his father
had subjected him did not in the least hurt Karl
Witte. It is one which any conscientious and intelligent
parent may make use of for his own children
if he so desires. And, to my way of thinking, children
reared in this way will have a far better chance
for success and happiness in after years than would
otherwise be theirs.</p>

<h2>V<br /><br />

THE PROBLEM OF LAZINESS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom what has already been said, it is evident
that there are at least three fundamental
principles to be observed by all
parents who would give their children a good start in
life. Care must be taken to set the little ones a really
good parental example; they must be surrounded
from the dawn of consciousness by a favourable environment;
and the effort should be made by direct
instruction to develop in them habits of right thinking
and acting before wrong habits have time to get
formed. To these three principles a fourth must
now be added: the exercise of constant vigilance to
detect and correct any physical disabilities, no matter
how trivial they may seem to be.</p>

<p>As was noted when discussing the case of the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
who “goes wrong,” even comparatively slight physical
defects, by causing neural stress, may contribute
directly to the making of the juvenile delinquent.
So, too, mental development may be hampered by
unfavourable conditions of bodily health. This, of
course, has long been recognised in a general way.
But in essential details it still is a fact far too little
appreciated by the majority of parents. Nay, it is
ignored or misunderstood even by some scientific students
of the nature of man, as is shown, for example,
by the varying views held to-day regarding that widespread
human frailty, laziness.</p>

<p>Only a short time ago, looking through some scientific
works bearing on a complicated educational
problem, I was greatly struck by two pronouncements
concerning laziness. On the one hand I found
an eminent physiologist declaring unreservedly,
“The love of work and activity is an acquired characteristic
rather than a natural one; for the human
tendency is toward the line of least effort.” And
opposed to this another authority asserted with equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
emphasis, “There never was a child born into this
world who was born into it lazy.”</p>

<p>To reconcile these statements is a manifest impossibility.
Yet it is certain that each of them finds in
facts of everyday observation a strong body of evidence
to support it. The average child of tender
years, as every parent knows, is supremely active and
energetic. He is always in motion, always busying
himself about something, his mind alert and inquiring,
his hands ceaselessly occupied in testing, exploring,
putting together, and taking to pieces. Left to himself,
he often will display an amazing tenacity of purpose
and vigour of performance.</p>

<p>Of one child, less than a year old, a close observer
has recorded, “He would over and over again seem
to be trying to solve the problem of the hinge to his
nursery door, patiently and with riveted attention
opening and shutting the door. Day after day saw
him at his self-appointed task.” Another, fourteen
months old, while playing with a tin can, was seen to
put the cover on and off “not less than seventy-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
times without stopping for a moment.” The incessant
questioning with which children bombard their
parents is another impressive indication of their exuberant,
irrepressible activity and energy. But,
for that matter, the whole life of the average child
goes to corroborate the dictum that the people of
this world come into it free from the taint of laziness.</p>

<p>When, however, we look at the same child grown to
manhood, or even a few years removed from early
youth, more often than not his behaviour seems to
bear out the contrary view that man is naturally lazy
and acquires love of work, if at all, only under strong
compulsion. “To get results from my boys, to induce
them to apply themselves to their books and their
studies,” many a despairing school-teacher has lamented,
“I have to be forever watching and driving
them.” In college, office, factory, workshop, and
store, one hears the same complaint. There is perpetual
waste of time, dawdling, loitering, gossiping—a
seeming passion for the ways of slothful ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
and aversion from sustained endeavour. To a large
extent, too, the history even of those who have won
distinction as leaders of thought and action seemingly
justifies the doctrine that mankind is naturally
prone to idleness rather than to productive activity,
and that any tendency in the latter direction is invariably
a characteristic acquired in the course of
individual development.</p>

<p>Thus Charles Darwin, world-famous for his splendid
contributions to the advance of science, was so
lazy in boyhood that his father predicted he would
turn out a ne’er-do-well and a disgrace to the family.
His great contemporary, Sir Charles Lyell, similarly
had as a boy a profound dislike for work of any
sort. Heinrich Heine, on his own confession, idled
away his time in school, and was “horribly bored”
by the instruction given him at Göttingen. According
to an American psychologist, Edgar James Swift,
who has made an extensive study of the boyhood of
great men, Wordsworth up to the age of seventeen
was so lazy as to be “wholly incapable of continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
application to prescribed work.” Of Patrick Henry
it is recorded by an early biographer that in boyhood
“he was too idle to gain any solid advantage
from the opportunities which were thrown in his
way.” And, after his schooling was done, indolence
caused him to fail dismally in several business ventures
before he took up the study of law.</p>

<p>When James Russell Lowell was a boy his relatives
were greatly distressed by his laziness, and he was
suspended by the authorities of Harvard University
“on account of continual neglect of his college duties.”
A boyhood friend who had unusual facilities
for observation is credited with having repeatedly
declared that “there never was so idle a dog as young
Humphry,” afterward Sir Humphry Davy of scientific
renown. “My master,” Samuel Johnson once
remarked, in speaking of his school-boy days,
“whipped me very hard. Without that, sir, I should
have done nothing.” Balzac, who wrote so many
novels, yet did not let one appear until it had undergone
repeated revision, confessed that not only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
boyhood but throughout the years of his literary labours
he was tormented by longings for an existence
of pleasure-seeking leisure. Through the lips of his
famous character, Raphael de Valentin, here is what
he says of himself:</p>

<p>“Since the age of reason until the day when I had
finished my task, I observed, read, wrote without
ceasing, and my life was like a long imposition; an
effeminate lover of oriental indolence, enamoured of
my dreams, sensual, I have always worked, refusing
to allow myself to taste the joys of Parisian life;
gourmand, I have been temperate; enjoying movement
and sea voyages, longing to visit other countries,
still finding pleasure, like a child, in making
ducks and drakes on the water, I remained constantly
seated, pen in hand.”</p>

<p>Taking into consideration facts like these, the evidence
would certainly seem to be in favour of the view
that, in yielding to a desire for idleness, men are,
after all, only following the dictate of Nature. But,
recalling the intense activity, the abounding energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of childhood, recalling also the demonstrable truth
that in most cases even the laziest of school-boys has
had a past characterised by the reverse of laziness,
just as he may have, like Darwin, Lyell, and the rest,
a future of marvellous accomplishment, the mind must
once more incline to the opposite belief.</p>

<p>It may be, and, as will be shown, it undoubtedly is,
somewhat of an exaggeration to say that there never
has been a congenitally lazy man. But to say this
is far nearer the truth than to regard laziness as
something rooted in the constitution of our being, and
love of activity as merely an acquired characteristic.
On the contrary, the sharp contrast between the activity
and energy of the average child and the idling
propensities of the average man, points unmistakably
to the development of laziness as a parasitic
growth interfering with the normal processes and
tendencies of nature. Laziness, in other words, must
be looked upon as essentially a pathological condition.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of condemning the lazy man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
as the moralists would, it is the part of wisdom to
view him as a victim of disease and as standing in
need of careful treatment. Nature intended him to
be vigorous, forceful, a being of achievement; circumstances
have made him listless, inert, responsive
but in feeble measure to the spur of honour, ambition,
pride, love, or necessity. Sometimes, to be sure,
he is contented with his laziness, and would almost
resent an attempt to rescue him from it; more frequently
he writhes in secret over a defect which he
realises exposes him to the contempt and ridicule of
his more virile fellow-men, and renders his life an
empty, profitless existence. As one unhappy victim
confessed in a moment of extraordinary self-revelation:</p>

<p>“I begin, but do not finish. When I conceive a
work, a feverish impatience seizes me to reach the
desired aim; I should like to attain it at once. But
to accomplish something, patient and continuous efforts
are required. I never accomplish anything....
One dull day, in one of the suburbs, I saw a large piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
of waste land, more covered with fragments of earthenware
than with grass. Three or four houses had
been commenced, charming little dwellings of red
brick and white stone; the walls had been there for
two or three years, but the floors and ceilings were
lacking, the roofs had never been tiled, and one could
see across the ever wide-open windows. My mind
is in a similar condition—a rough plain with several
pretty houses, the roofs of which will never be finished.”
(<cite>The Fortnightly Review</cite>, vol. lxix, p. 763.)</p>

<p>What, then, is the cause of laziness? How should
one proceed in the attempt to cure it? Still more
important in this complex and severely competitive
age, with its incessant demand for vigour and effectiveness
of performance, what are the preventive
measures that may be taken in the interest alike of
the individual and society?</p>

<p>Only a few years ago it would have been impossible
to answer these questions in any but the vaguest
and most general way. It might have been said—indeed,
it was said—that laziness is essentially an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
infirmity of the will. No statement could be more
correct, but also none could be more futile in the absence
of any clear appreciation of the factors determining
the weakness or strength of one’s will-power.
For, as somebody has truly said, the will is
not an isolated entity, absolutely independent of,
and superior to, the organism through which it operates.
Having a controlling force, it still is, to a
large extent, itself controlled by material as well as
by psychical circumstances, by bodily states and by
the impressions the mind absorbs from the environment.
Consequently the solution of the problem of
laziness depends at bottom on the ascertainment of
the factors hurtful to efficient willing.</p>

<p>This task quite recently has been essayed with remarkable
success, and, especially by a little group of
French investigators, with immediate reference to the
problem presented by the lazy man. Laziness in all
its phases has been studied with the resourcefulness
and painstaking precision characteristic of the new
school of medical psychologists, to whom we are al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>ready
so heavily indebted for a better understanding
of the mind of man both in its normal and its abnormal
aspects. And with respect to laziness they have
likewise made some interesting and important discoveries.</p>

<p>What, in particular, they have found is that it is
usually associated with a peculiarly debilitated condition
of the nervous system—an “asthenia”
marked by a slow heart-beat, low arterial pressure,
and poor circulation. The consequence of this is, to
quote Théodule Ribot, one of the leaders in the scientific
study of laziness, that “the brain shows not
so much an indisposition as a real incapacity for concentrating
attention, and soon, owing to the fact
that its nourishment is at the vanishing-point, becomes
exhausted.” A whole series of idlers, tested
scientifically, were shown to be suffering from this
asthenic condition, which led them instinctively to
husband their feeble resources by the simple expedient
of exerting themselves no more than was absolutely
necessary. Yet not a few of them were to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
appearance healthy enough, and, until the medical
examination had been made, it was difficult to credit
their well-grounded complaint that they really felt
“too tired to work,” and at best could do so “only
by fits and starts.”</p>

<p>This is not to say that they were all of them “born
tired.” Congenitally weak many of them may have
been; but the more the investigators familiarised
themselves with the asthenia of the lazy, the more they
found reason for the belief that, as a rule, it was an
acquired and functional rather than an inborn and
organic weakness, although often initiated by local
troubles organic in nature. Thus, studying laziness
in children attending school, it was discovered that
quite frequently their inertia is connected with the
presence of adenoid, or abnormal tissue, growths, in
the cavity back of the nose. These growths, by
making it extremely hard for the child to breathe
properly, deplete his vitality so that he remains undersized
and is quickly fatigued by intellectual or
muscular effort. The natural consequence is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
he becomes more or less of an idler, bringing upon
himself the reproaches and punishments of parents
and teachers. What he actually needs is not scoldings
or whippings but a slight surgical operation.</p>

<p>Often a surprising development of both mental and
physical power follows the removal of the adenoids.
In one case, reported by Professor Swift, a girl of
fourteen grew three inches taller within six months
after an operation for adenoids, and at the same time
showed an improvement in her school-work that contrasted
strikingly with the apathy and dulness that
had preceded it. Another, three years younger,
grew six inches in about four months, and from being
a sad idler was transformed into an unexpectedly attractive
and bright pupil. A boy of twelve, backward
both mentally and physically, likewise lost his
dulness and laziness within an astonishingly short
time after the impediment to his breathing had been
removed.</p>

<p>Dental defects also contribute materially to the
development of laziness and mental retardation. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
has been repeatedly demonstrated in individual cases,
and at least one psychologist—Professor J. E. Wallace
Wallin, of St. Louis—has demonstrated it in
the case of a group of children.</p>

<p>These children, twenty-seven in number, were pupils
in a Cleveland public school; they were afflicted
with tooth-decay to a varying extent, and they were
mentally backward, being from one to four years retarded
in their school-work. At Professor Wallin’s
direction their teeth and gums were treated, they
were taught to use a tooth-brush properly, and to
chew their food thoroughly. Before the dental treatment
began they were twice given five psychological
tests, to ascertain their memory-power, attention-power,
etc.; the same tests were twice given to them
while the treatment was under way; and, six months
after its termination, or just before the close of the
school-year 1910–1911, the tests were again given
twice.</p>

<p>Comparing the results of the different testings, a
progressive and remarkable improvement was found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
In ability to memorise, the average improvement for
the group was 19 per cent.; in attention power, 60
per cent.; in adding, 35 per cent.; in ability to associate
words having an opposite meaning, 129 per
cent.; and in general association ability, 42 per cent.
More than this, and testifying incontrovertibly to the
direct influence of the dental treatment in promoting
vigour of thought, only one of the children failed of
promotion, six completed thirty-eight weeks of school-work
in twenty-four weeks, and one boy did two years’
work in one year. Yet all of these children, remember,
had formerly been quite unable to keep up with
the work of their grades.</p>

<p>How explain this great improvement? Only on
the theory that, by repairing their teeth and drilling
them in the rudiments of mouth hygiene, a stop had
been put to a disease-process which involved both
nervous strain and—through the swallowing of the
toxic products of tooth-decay—a poisoning of the
supply of blood to the brain, with consequent lessening
of the brain’s ability to function properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>Eye trouble, particularly in the way of hypermetropia,
or far-sightedness, is another frequent
cause of laziness in school-children, and the correction
of the defective vision often is followed by a
marked access of vigour and alertness. In such
cases, however, the laziness is usually manifest only
in the school-room, the child being active enough at
play, when no strain is put on the eyes comparable
with that occasioned by reading.</p>

<p>To cite a single instance, a little boy of ten was
reported as being so inattentive at school and so uninterested
in his work as to yawn and become sleepy
when required to read. As no amount of scolding
sufficed to turn him from his idle ways, and as he
began to complain of headaches and nervousness, he
was finally taken to an oculist. To the surprise of
his parents, who had always believed his vision normal,
he was found to be suffering from latent hypermetropia;
and, on being provided with the proper eye-glasses,
he soon demonstrated, by the rapidity with
which he improved in his studies and the interest he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
now showed in them, that his laziness had been determined
by the condition of his eyesight.</p>

<p>In fact, any bodily defect that is of such a character
as to impose an excessive strain on the nervous
system tends to produce an asthenic condition, with
accompanying apathy and indolence. And, even
when the local trouble is only temporary, its disappearance
is not necessarily followed, as it was in the
instances just narrated, by a return to energetic, effective
activity. For, in the meantime, the idler may
have acquired an unconscious—or, to be more precise,
a subconscious—belief that sustained exertion
is and always must be beyond his powers. Thus a
vicious circle is established, the belief in his incapacity
causing him to act in such a way as to intensify
the asthenic state, and the resultant increased
feeling of debility operating, in its turn, to confirm
and strengthen his erroneous belief. In other words,
he is now suffering chiefly from a “fixed idea,” and
his condition is that of any psycho-neurotic patient.</p>

<p>On this point all who have made a scientific study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of laziness are in substantial agreement. We must,
flatly affirms the pioneer investigator Doctor Maurice
de Fleury, “take the indolent for what they nearly
always are—neuropaths; and neurosis for what it
always is—bad habits of cerebral activity.” The
longer a man has been an idler, the more deeply
rooted, of course, will be his subconscious conviction
that exertion is impossible to him; but, according to
de Fleury and other investigators, once this conviction
is broken down, he will find that he can work, and
work to good purpose.</p>

<p>The effecting of a cure, needless to say, is not always
easy. It requires co-operation on the part of
the patient, and on the physician’s part intelligent
and sympathetic use of both physiological and
psychological methods of treatment. Hygienic measures
must be adopted to tone up the nervous system,
to improve the circulation, the digestion, the nutrition—to
develop, as far as possible, a general feeling
of well-being. The idler must gradually be
trained to occupy himself usefully—not, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
for many hours at a time, but for regular stated
periods, however short. And to this end, the effort
has to be made, from the outset, to awaken in him
an absorbing interest in the attainment of some one
specific aim in life, thereby replacing his baneful
fixed idea of incapacity for work with the opposed
and beneficial obsession of something that he must
and can accomplish.</p>

<p>Here we come to what is by far the most important
factor in the cure of laziness—the dynamic,
regenerative power of some special interest.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Even
your idler, enfeebled by positive organic weakness,
may rise superior to himself and achieve marvels, if
only his enthusiasm be sufficiently aroused to a
definite end. It was thus, for example, with Charles
Darwin.</p>

<p>When he was a boy, as was said above, Darwin was
colossally lazy. He neglected his books, and spent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>his days roaming through the fields, gun in hand.
“You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching,
and you will be a disgrace to yourself and
all your family,” was his father’s bitter reproof.
As he grew older, his propensity for idling seemed
only to increase. In spite of this, hoping against
hope that he would yet settle down to serious things,
his father entered him at the University of Glasgow,
with the idea of fitting him for the practice of medicine.
“It is no use,” the boy frankly avowed, after
a few months at Glasgow; “I hate the work here, and
I cannot possibly be a physician.” So earnest were
his protests that he was transferred to Cambridge
University, on the understanding that he would study
to be a clergyman.</p>

<p>At Cambridge, as good fortune would have it, he
entered the natural history class of an eminent and
enlightened scholar, Professor Henslow, who sent him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>into the woods and fields to make collections of plants
and insects. Free again to roam under the clear
blue skies, but this time with a lofty purpose set before
his mind, a passion for achievement took possession
of him. The boy whom other teachers had found
dull and lazy proved himself, under Professor Henslow’s
inspiring guidance, a marvel of industry and
mental vigour. There was no longer any thought of
the “last resort” plan of putting him into the ministry.
He would, he told his delighted father, become
a naturalist, and he would work hard.</p>

<p>And he did work hard. Though his health was
permanently impaired by the hardships of a voyage
of exploration, so that “for nearly forty years he
never knew one day of the health of ordinary men,”
and “every day succumbed to the exhaustion brought
on by the slightest effort,” he nevertheless found a
way to work with an effectiveness few men of normal
health have equalled.</p>

<p>The establishment of regular hours for work—thus
gradually forming a work habit which itself con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>stituted
a sort of fixed idea contrary to the idea of
indolence, and the reinforcement of this work habit
by enthusiastic pre-occupation with an inspiring theme—such
was the secret of Charles Darwin’s mastery
over ills more serious than those which have made
countless men lifelong idlers. What he did is precisely
what the medical psychologist of to-day prescribes
as fundamental in the successful treatment of
laziness. Listen to the wise Doctor de Fleury:</p>

<p>“Let it be known that it is often possible in the
practice of life to replace an absurd idea by a good
fixed one, and to form excellent habits in the place of
deplorable manias. It is precisely in doing this that
the psychological treatment of indolence consists;
it is this patient work that the doctor of misguided
minds ought to undertake.</p>

<p>“To induce [a lazy person] to become possessed
of a good fixed idea, is not a superhuman work for
those who know how to set about it. In fact, the
means to be employed remind one of a woman who
wishes to make herself loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us consider for a moment the means dictated
to her by her infallible instinct concerning love affairs.
First of all, she dresses herself with care, so
as to show off her charms to the full; then she finds
opportunities for constantly being seen, increases the
number of meetings; her presence must become habitual—in
fact, necessary; he must suffer when she
is no longer near. She kindles the flame of jealousy,
to make it understood that she is an incomparable
treasure, and that another will grasp her if he does
not stretch forth his arm in time.</p>

<p>“Imitate her, you who wish to learn the marvellous
art of reclaiming the indolent. Help your patient
to choose a work really suited to his abilities; embellish
the idea [of it] with all the hope that it is
possible to raise—self-content, worldly importance,
glory, and fortune to be conquered. Talk about it
without ceasing; like a Wagnerian motive, repeat it
again and again, and soon you will find that the brain
seizes the idea, and can no longer exist without this
good obsession. Finally, when the idea becomes cher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>ished,
when the brain loves it as one loves and desires
a woman, make it to be understood that it belongs to
all, that it is in the air, that another, braver and more
manly, may step in and carry it off....</p>

<p>“Naturally, it is necessary to vary one’s advice
according to the character and profession of each
patient. I have had the opportunity of treating—for
nervous affections and at the same time for indolence—men
occupying the most varied social positions:
students, composers, military officers, men of
letters, lawyers, financiers, politicians, poor workmen,
and idle, rich people. For each one of them it was
necessary to choose a ruling idea, suited to his occupation
and in proportion to his strength.”</p>

<p>Treatment by suggestion, then, plus careful preliminary
physiological, and if necessary medical,
treatment to ameliorate the asthenic condition common
to idlers—that is the proper course to pursue
in dealing with all cases of laziness. And it is also
the course to pursue in the more important matter of
prevention, a matter which, as the case of Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Darwin strikingly suggests, rests chiefly with fathers
and mothers.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that, as things now stand, young
men and women choose vocations in a haphazard way,
and too often choose vocations for which Nature has
not intended them. What it is equally important to
recognise is that even when they do happen to hit on
a vocation fitted to them, it is only the exceptional
man or woman who works anywhere near the limit of
his or her capacity. The great majority fritter
away much of their time, and may justly be accused
of idleness.</p>

<p>The surprising thing about this is that, as has already
been pointed out, it is seldom one sees anything
like real laziness in early childhood. What causes
the sharp contrast between the activity of childhood
and the frequent apathy of later years? Unfavourable
physical conditions cannot be held wholly responsible,
especially when it is observed that there
always are some people who, like Darwin, contrive to
work effectively despite serious physical shortcom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>ings.
One must look a little deeper, and, looking
deeper, one finds, as medical psychologists have lately
found, that the trouble lies mostly with the parental
attitude in childhood and youth.</p>

<p>Too many parents discourage the ceaseless questioning
of their children, and thereby deaden that
great stimulus to effort—curiosity. Too many fail
to direct their children’s thoughts into really worth
while channels. Too many daily give them an example,
not of industrious activity, but of half-hearted
endeavour. All this goes to create in the child habits
inimical to real work; and in proportion as he is
afterward, by parent or teacher, forced to work, he
finds work burdensome and exhausting. Under this
condition, whether or no he is suffering from adenoids,
eye trouble, or any other physical cause of nervous
strain, he is likely to develop the asthenic state of the
true idler, with the result of soon or late feeling that
sustained effort is beyond him.</p>

<p>On parents, therefore, ultimately rests the blame
for the prevalence of laziness; and for its prevention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
we must likewise look to parents. As a friend, a
prominent American medical psychologist, once said
to me emphatically:</p>

<p>“There would be far fewer lazy men in the world
if parents only appreciated the possibility of so influencing
their children in early youth as to confirm
them in the tendencies to energetic action and fruitful
thinking which they usually display in the first
years of life. Instead of neglecting or repressing
these tendencies, as so many parents unfortunately
do, they should encourage their children in the active
use of their minds, should train them in habits of systematic
and effective thinking, and especially, by observing
just what aptitudes they most clearly show,
should take pains to cultivate in them an abiding interest
in the subjects for which they seem to have
greatest talent.</p>

<p>“If they would only do this, and would at the same
time keep a close watch for any symptoms of nerve-strain
due to organic or functional disturbances, correcting
these at the earliest possible moment, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
should hear much less than we do now of the indolence
of the average child of school age; and we certainly
should be taking a great forward step in the
lessening of laziness among grown men and women.
For, obviously, a child habituated from infancy to
the fullest and freest use of his natural powers, will
be likely to continue thinking and acting energetically
in later life. In this, as in everything else, the law
is the same—as the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.”</p>

<h2>VI<br /><br />

A CHAPTER ON LAUGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>icture to yourself a familiar scene—the
interior of a theatre crowded with people.
On the stage the persons of the play move
to and fro, speaking their lines. Presently a slight
change is made in the current of the dialogue, and,
presto! the spectators who have been so quietly listening
and watching become weirdly agitated. Their
features are distorted in strange grimaces, they
throw back their heads, and give utterance to abrupt,
explosive, unmelodious noises. Even their bodies
take part in the amazing commotion.</p>

<p>Something “funny” has just been said by one of
the actors, and those who have heard it are responding
by an outburst of “laughter.”</p>

<p>Recall likewise the equally familiar picture of a
huge circus tent with its bewildering array of equip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>ment
for the performance of feats of strength and
daring, surrounded by tier upon tier of seats filled
with expectant holiday-makers. The entertainment
is about to begin; from an entrance come the blaring
strains of a brass band, and a long, gaily bedecked
procession circles slowly before the gaping throng.
At the end of the procession are half a dozen men of
uncouth gait and bizarre appearance, their faces
whitened and spotted, queer conical caps on their
heads, and wearing enormous, shapeless garments as
white and spotted as their faces.</p>

<p>These men say nothing—they simply go through
all sorts of foolish antics. But at the mere sight of
them the same uproar of discordant sounds fills the
air, the spectators, like those of the theatre and with
even greater vehemence, uniting in a very bedlam
of guffaws.</p>

<p>Pass, finally, to the open street, alive with men and
women hurrying to their work. Some one has carelessly
dropped on the sidewalk the slippery skin of
a fruit. The first man to step on it feels his legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
give way beneath him, strives frantically to keep
his balance, waves his arms about, and ends by plumping
to the ground with a heavy thud. At once he is
beset by the “smiles” and “chuckles” of those who
have witnessed his fall; and, hurt and annoyed, he
scrambles to his feet, gives himself a hasty brush,
and disappears as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>Now, just what is this singular phenomenon of
laughter, so readily induced and from such a variety
of causes? What is there in the words of an actor,
the antics of a clown, or the misfortune of another
person, to provoke, under the circumstances mentioned,
the peculiar reaction of bodily and facial contortion
and inarticulate vocal utterance that, regarded
dispassionately, seems almost repulsive?
What useful purpose can be served by such behaviour,
such an obvious departure from the well-ordered ways
of the reasoning life? In a word, why do we laugh?</p>

<p>It is a question far more easily asked than answered,
as every one has discovered who has really
pondered it. The answer that immediately comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
mind—“We laugh because we are amused”—not
only is hopelessly inadequate, but to a large extent is
incorrect. It can readily be shown that people sometimes
laugh in situations where their mental state is
anything but that of amusement. In one well-authenticated
instance a frontiersman, on returning to
his home and finding it in ruins, with his wife and
children mutilated corpses, began to laugh and continued
laughing until he died from the rupture of a
blood-vessel. In another case, cited among the responses
to a questionnaire on laughter issued by that
well-known American psychologist, President G.
Stanley Hall of Clark University, a number of young
people from nineteen to twenty-four years of age
were sitting together when the death of a friend was
announced. “They looked at each other for a second,
and then all began to laugh, and it was some
time before they could become serious.”</p>

<p>A young woman, replying to the same questionnaire,
confessed that she often laughed when hearing
people speak of the death of their friends, “not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>cause
it is funny or pleases her, but because she cannot
help it.” Another young woman reported that
on hearing of the death of a former school-mate she
felt deeply grieved, yet “laughed as heartily as she
had ever done in her life,” and, in spite of every effort
to control herself, “had to break out into a
laugh repeatedly.” A third “must always laugh
when she hears of a death, and has had to leave the
church at a funeral because she must giggle.”</p>

<p>Even the shock of a severe physical pain is known
to provoke occasionally, not tears but laughter. “A
young man,” says C. G. Lange, “whom I was treating
with a powerful caustic for an ulceration of the
tongue, invariably, at the moment when the pain was
at its highest, was attacked by a violent outburst of
laughter.”</p>

<p>One has only to think also of the laughter caused
by tickling to realise that it is not always true to say
that we laugh because we are amused. And when it
is true, this answer, instead of solving the problem
of laughter, merely raises it in another form, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
it then becomes necessary to explain why we are
amused by the sayings and happenings at which we
laugh. Most students of laughter have indeed felt
that the important thing to do is to determine
the nature of the laughable, a task itself of considerable
difficulty and leading to the most diverse conclusions
in the numerous explanatory formulas which
have been advanced from time to time, but which,
when closely scrutinised, are chiefly noteworthy for
their incompleteness.</p>

<p>To mention only a few of the theories of the comic
finding place in psychological works, it is affirmed
by some authorities that the essence of the laughable
is that it induces a sudden sense of superiority in the
person moved to laughter. This is the “sudden
glory” theory of Thomas Hobbes, and in support
of it is cited more especially the familiar fact that
nobody likes to be laughed at. It also finds support
in the undoubted feeling of contempt which so often
accompanies the laughter provoked by the buffooneries
of a mountebank, the dialogue and action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
of a farce comedy, and the so-called “comic pictures”
now to be found in such lamentable profusion
in many of our newspapers. In some slight degree,
too, there may be a “sudden glory” in the laughter
at the awkwardness and groundless fears of a child,
or at his naïve remarks, and in the laughter occasioned
by mischances to other people. But certainly
there is much that is laughable—notably the kindly
banter between friends—that cannot reasonably be
said to engender any feeling of superiority. And,
more than this, we are all of us, every day of our
lives, witnessing things that do suddenly arouse in
us a lively feeling of superiority, but without moving
us to laughter—moving us, rather, to pity and perhaps
tears.</p>

<p>Even as amended by the psychologist Bain, the
“sudden glory” theory remains inadequate. Bain
defines “the occasion of the ludicrous” as “the
degradation of some person or interest possessing
dignity in circumstances that excite no other strong
emotion.” This is a decided improvement, because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
clearly recognises that the laughable must be devoid
of elements awakening counteracting emotions. But
it is open to the criticism that laughter is frequently
excited by objects and occurrences in which, unless
the imagination be severely wrenched, it is impossible
to assume that ideas of degradation are dominant or
even operant.</p>

<p>When, for example, we laugh at the spectacle of a
child half hidden in his grandfather’s hat, what do
we think of as degraded? Is it the child, the hat, or
the absent grandfather? In such an instance can
the idea of degradation properly be said to enter at
all? So, likewise, it is difficult to conceive the presence
of any idea either of degradation or superiority
in the ringing laughter of a child at his puppy’s
gambols or at the frisking of his kitten. And how
explain on such a principle the laughter at non-malicious
witticism?</p>

<p>Appreciating the inapplicability of the Hobbesian
doctrine in any form as explanatory of all sources
of laughter, other investigators have emphasised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
principle of contrast and incongruity, but to scarcely
more satisfactory effect. “Laughter,” says Herbert
Spencer, “naturally results only when consciousness
is unawares transferred from great things
to small—when there is what we call a descending
incongruity.” The manifest insufficiency of this
theory is avoided in the more extensive one, to which
Darwin inclines, defining the laughable as that which
is queer, unusual, disagreeing with or contrary to
our mental habits or the normal order of affairs.
Assuredly there is almost always an element of queerness
in the things at which we laugh. Yet it is also
certain that the queer does not always make us
laugh. As Camille Mélinaud has pointed out:</p>

<p>“There are things contrary to the normal order
that have nothing ludicrous about them; and if the
view were true that queerness is the laughable element,
those things that are strangest and most unusual
should be the ones most certain by their very
nature to excite laughter. But we do not laugh at
the dancing horses, the jumping pigs, the musicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
playing on bottles, of the circus, all of which are
most contradictory of what we are accustomed to.
If we laugh at the circus, it is at the accessory jokes
and incidents in the detail. A conjurer’s tricks,
seemingly contradictory as they are of all our experiences
and notions, do not make us laugh. We
laugh at his jokes and his funny ways of proceeding,
but we wonder at his tricks.” (<cite>Popular Science
Monthly</cite>, vol. liii, p. 398.)</p>

<p>Mélinaud’s own view, oddly enough, is about as
unconvincing as any that has ever been formulated,
for, while laying stress on the principle of incongruity,
he insists that laughter comes only when the
laugher, “by a rapid process of thought,” submits
the object of his mirth to a reflective analysis and
arrives at the laugh-provoking conclusion that what
seems absurd is really quite natural from the point
of view of the person or thing laughed at. Then,
and not until then, do we feel amused. On such a
theory one might well wonder that children ever find
it possible to laugh, and that laughter is so prev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>alent
among adults who are not accustomed to
any very high degree of logical thinking.</p>

<p>Altogether different from any of the foregoing is
the more recent theory of the French philosopher,
Henri Bergson, as presented in a special treatise on
laughter, of which an excellent translation by C.
Brereton and F. Rothwell has lately been published
in this country. Bergson recognises, as not every
investigator has done, the essentially spontaneous
character of laughter, and he insists with Darwin on
postulating queerness as an indispensable element in
the laughable. But, as he sees it, the queerness must
be of a specific sort in order to excite laughter—must
consist, in fine, in an automatic inelasticity,
whether of form, action, or thought, which is in sharp
contrast to the wonted mobility of life. It is our
immediate recognition of this automatism and
rigidity that moves us to laughter.</p>

<p>When, Bergson affirms, we laugh at a man who
stumbles and falls in the street, our laughter is
caused, not by his sudden change of attitude, but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the involuntary element in this change. “Perhaps
there was a stone on the road. He should have altered
his pace or avoided the obstacle. Instead of
that, through lack of elasticity, through absent-mindedness
and a kind of physical obstinacy—as a
result, in fact, of rigidity or of momentum—the
muscles continued to perform the same movement
when the circumstances of the case called for something
else. That is the reason of the man’s fall,
and also of the people’s laughter.” So with our
laughter at the appearance and horseplay of a clown.
We laugh at his painted face because we immediately
recognise in it “something mechanical encrusted
upon the living,” and we laugh at his antics because
of their automatic, machine-like character.</p>

<p>In fact, “We laugh every time a person gives us
the impression of being a thing. We laugh at
Sancho Panza tumbled into a bed-quilt and tossed
into the air like a foot-ball. We laugh at Baron
Munchausen turned into a cannon-ball and travelling
through space.” In laughter caused by puns, jests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
and witticisms, the same principles of automatism
and inelasticity obtain, though of course in much
subtler form. Analyse closely all varieties of the
comic and you always get back to the basic idea of
“something mechanical in something living.” Or,
Bergson concludes, “The comic is that side of a person
which reveals his likeness to a thing, that aspect
of human events which, through its peculiar inelasticity,
conveys the impression of pure mechanism,
of automatism, of movement without life.”</p>

<p>Really to appreciate both the plausibility and the
shortcomings of this novel theory of the laughable
one must read Professor Bergson’s book. It is there
elaborated so ingeniously that one finds it difficult to
give instances of the comic to which it cannot in some
way be applied. Even the laughter of children at
the bobbing up of their jack-in-the-box, the fall of
their house of cards, or the tail-chasing gyrations of
their kitten, may conceivably be explained on the
assumption that what the children laugh at is the
automatic character of the bobbing, the falling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the whirling. On the other hand, these very examples
irresistibly suggest that the Bergsonian explanation
is, after all, rather strained and far-fetched,
and that, in common with its less thorough-going
predecessors, it overlooks the elusive something
fundamental to the laughable. This impression
is deepened when we recall the extent to which
automatism, rigidity, inelasticity, prevail in the affairs
of men without exciting so much as a smile.</p>

<p>“The attitudes, gestures, and movements of the
human body,” says Professor Bergson, in stating one
of his many subsidiary laws of the comic, “are
laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds
us of a mere machine.” Why, then, do we not laugh
when we observe the machine-like precision with
which a company of soldiers march on parade or execute
the evolutions of drill? Surely one could not
find a better example of “something mechanical in
something living.” And, again, “any arrangement
of acts and events is comic which gives us, in a single
combination, the illusion of life and the distinct im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>pression
of a mechanical arrangement.” The bobbing
of the jack-in-the-box meets this formula, and
we do laugh at the jack-in-the-box. But it is
met equally well by the strangely lifelike movements
of such devices as the automatic chess-player and the
type-setting machine, yet these do not ordinarily
elicit any appreciable manifestation of mirth.</p>

<p>It is, however, when we turn to Bergson’s deductions
from his theory of the comic that we are most
strongly impelled to question its soundness. Emphasizing
as he does the element of automatism in the
laughable, he logically enough infers that the function
of laughter is to serve as a social corrective.
“The rigid, the ready-made, the mechanical, in contrast
with the supple, the ever-changing, and the living,
absent-mindedness in contrast with attention,
in a word, automatism in contrast with free activity,
such are the defects that laughter singles out and
would fain correct.” We laugh, that is to say, only
at imperfections in our fellow-men, or at things which
remind us of imperfections, and the reason we laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
is that, consciously or unconsciously, we wish to call
attention to them by way of, in Bergson’s own words,
“a kind of social ragging.”</p>

<p>Stated thus baldly, the underlying defect of such
an explanation of laughter becomes plainly apparent.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
What has happened is that its author has
read into the phenomenon of laughter a meaning applicable
only under special circumstances. If it were
true that we laugh only at what is imperfect and
therefore ugly, however attenuated in ugliness, it
would be impossible to understand the well-nigh universal
eagerness for laughter; an eagerness which has
led mankind to reward lavishly, even extravagantly,
those who make it their business to provide occasions
for laughter—the writers of farces and comedies,
the fun-making actors and clowns, the producers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>“comic pictures.” The egregious falsity of this
“deformity” theory, as it may fairly be called, becomes
still more manifest when we endeavour to apply
it to account for the laughter of childhood, the
period of life when laughter is most free and exuberant,
but precisely when it is incredible to assume
that it is motivated by any corrective impulse,
conscious or otherwise.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the attempt to reach a wholly
satisfactory solution of the problem of laughter by
striving to define the characteristics of the laughable
seems foredoomed to failure. For, after all, the
laughable must always remain a more or less uncertain
quantity, if only for the reason that, as shown
by facts of everyday observation, what makes one
person laugh may not be in the least laugh-provoking
to another. Yet everybody, or almost everybody,
does laugh to some extent, and therefore the proper
point of approach would rather seem to be through
a study of the act of laughter itself and of its consequences
with regard, not to the person or thing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
phrase laughed at, but to the person doing the laughing.</p>

<p>Attacking the problem from this altogether different
angle, one is soon in a position to discern several
facts of real helpfulness in an explanatory way.
By no means the least important is the extreme exuberance
of laughter in childhood, to which reference
has just been made. Once the child has begun to
laugh—usually during the fourth or fifth month
after birth, although occasional outbursts of a
shadowy sort of laughter have been observed before
the fourth month—it laughs with a truly amazing
spontaneity and frequency. There seems to be nothing
which may not become an object of laughter to a
child, and, more than this, in direct contradiction to
all theories postulating a reflective element at the
bottom of every laugh, as often as not the laughter
of childhood is conspicuously devoid of such an element.</p>

<p>For example, to cite a few observations from the
record of a lady, Miss Milicent Shinn, whose pains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>taking
study of the infancy of her niece Ruth is
among the most stimulating of contributions to the
modern science of child psychology, it appears that
toward the end of the fifth month this little girl
“habitually laughed with glee when any one smiled
or spoke to her.” And when, two months later, she
was taken into the open and allowed to roll about on
a quilt, “the wooing of the passing freshness, the
play of sun and shadow, the large stir of life in
moving and sounding things, all this possessed her
and made her ‘laugh and ejaculate with pleasure.’”
Also, like almost every child of her age, little Ruth
would be moved to hilarious mirth by being given a
ride on somebody’s foot, or tossed and jumped about
in one’s arms. Laughter, again, followed the successful
accomplishment of any intellectual or muscular
feat, such as pointing out pictures she had been
asked to identify, climbing stairs, or deliberately letting
herself fall “so as to come down sitting with a
thud.”</p>

<p>The same tendency to excessive, even seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
causeless laughter in the opening years of life has
been noted by other close students of the emotions
and their expression. Some have attempted, with
the usual futile results, to explain it by an analysis
of the things at which the child laughs. Others,
more cautiously and more accurately, content themselves
with describing it as a means whereby Nature
provides a salutary outlet for surplus nervous
energy.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly this. Ask any child who has
learned to talk—or, better, ask a grown person who
has retained to a marked degree the faculty for
hearty laughter—and the chances are you will be
told that, while in any given instance the laugher
may be far from clear as to why he has laughed, he
does know that the involuntary movements of the
laughter to which he yielded were preceded by peculiarly
compelling sensations, variously expressed in
such phrases as, “I had to laugh or burst,” “I had to
do something to relieve the strain,” “I felt bubbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
over,” “I felt a quiver, a thrill, a creepy feeling passing
from my stomach to my mouth.”</p>

<p>That is to say, the evidence from the abounding
laughter of childhood—pre-eminently a period of
rapid physical growth and of the accumulation of a
large store of nervous energy—as also the evidence
from the laughter of unusually mirthful adults, who
are, as a rule, persons of large build and of corresponding
nervous force, suggests irresistibly the conception
of laughter as an instinct implanted in us for
the performance of an important physiological function.
This view finds additional support in the
familiar “giggling silliness” of the adolescent period,
that strange period of unusual growth and stress,
and the one in which are most likely to occur those
singular attacks of untimely hilarity at funerals and
on other solemn occasions, as mentioned among the
responses to President Hall’s questionnaire. No
more than the little child or your friend the jolly
man does the adolescent always know at what he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
laughing. He simply knows that he is impelled to
laugh by forces latent in his being and over which
he has no control.</p>

<p>Nor is it only as a relief from neural tension that
laughter benefits the one who laughs. In the studies
of laughter in childhood made by such investigators
as Preyer, Sully, and Miss Shinn, one finds frequent
allusion to occasions when laughter is obviously a
reaction from a state of mental strain, and has a
specifically useful effect in easing the mind. There
is reason to believe that this is actually one of its
constant ends—that it is a device for lightening the
burden of mentation by temporary interruption of
the thought process.</p>

<p>As all educators are well aware, the first years of
life and the adolescent period are not only the years
of greatest physical growth, but the years when the
severest demands are made on the mind, both by the
task of acquiring knowledge and by the perturbations
of adolescence. They are the years when the mind,
in its immaturity, is most in need of some protective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
mechanism to enable it automatically and at frequent
intervals to take a holiday as it were. Such a mechanism
is admirably provided in laughter, which, as
every laugher will at once appreciate, when not unduly
prolonged leaves behind it a pleasurable feeling
of exhilaration and greater mental as well as physical
well-being.</p>

<p>We laugh, then, in infancy and adolescence, not
primarily because we are “light-hearted” or
“amused,” but to satisfy a natural instinct of both
physiological and psychological utility. We laugh
less in maturity, partly because we have not, as a
rule, the same necessity of getting rid of surplus
nervous energy, partly because our minds have passed
the tender formative age, and partly because widening
experience has developed sentiments and ideas
tending to inhibit laughter. Nevertheless we do still
need to a certain extent the relief which laughter
brings; we feel in some degree the old hunger for it,
and consequently, often at very slight provocation,
we yield, and even cultivate opportunities for yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>ing,
to the impulse which was so conspicuously
operant in the years of our youth. As with every
instinct, moreover, the laughing process may, and
occasionally does, become perverted, as in the laughter
of cynicism and contempt, and in the abnormal
laughter of the overwrought—itself, however, the
modern medical psychologist assures us, a medium of
relief from an unbearable strain.</p>

<p>As to the things at which we commonly laugh—the
“laughable” whose nature has so perplexed
philosophers—all that may safely be said is that
their laugh-provoking power depends not so much
on an inherent “comicality” as on the circumstances
under which they occur to us, and our point of view
toward them as determined by previous training
and experience. Certainly, for instance, we cannot
laugh at a subtle bit of wit until we have had education
in the appreciation of the skilful use of language.
The instincts of imitation and of sympathy, further,
have a share in determining on many an occasion the
functioning of the laughing instinct. Time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
again we laugh merely because we see other people
laughing. Personally I am inclined to think also
that much at which we laugh as adults is laughable
to us only by reason of subconscious association with
similar occurrences which chanced to move us to
laughter in our childhood. But on this point nothing
positive should be asserted pending psychological
investigation which has yet to be made.</p>

<p>Conceding, however, that the laughable is and must
always remain elusive, baffling, uncertain, there need
be no uncertainty as to our view of laughter itself.
To laugh—to laugh spontaneously and heartily—is
under nearly every circumstance a good thing both
for the body and for the mind. Like sleep, it refreshes;
like food, it strengthens. Humanity in truth would
be the poorer—and the shorter-lived—were it ever
to lose this splendid heritage of the power to laugh.</p>

<p>This is why I have said so much about laughter in
the present book. To parents in especial knowledge
of its true significance is important. They will not
then fall into the mistake, too often made at present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of curbing their children’s instinctive tendency to
laugh. Rather, they should deliberately seek to cultivate
in them a keen sense of humour, and encourage
them in merriment—not because it is a thing pleasing
in itself, but because of its positive developmental
value. Directly or indirectly to repress this basic
instinct is always dangerous, leading to warpings of
character, and at times undoubtedly contributing to
the causation of that strangest and most misunderstood
of human maladies, hysteria, to which we must
now give some consideration.</p>

<h2>VII<br /><br />

HYSTERIA IN CHILDHOOD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> little girl, a pupil in a German
school, made her appearance in class
one morning with a bandage about her
head. In answer to her teacher’s questions, she said
she had been operated upon for ear trouble at a local
hospital the day before. She described every detail
of the operation, which, it seemed, had been exceedingly
painful.</p>

<p>For some time she wore the bandage to school
every day, and frequently complained that her ear
was still troubling her. Her teacher was properly
sympathetic, and, chancing to meet one of the girl’s
relatives, expressed her anxiety for the child, and the
hope that she would soon be completely cured.</p>

<p>“Cured?” repeated the relative. “Cured of
what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, her ear trouble—the disease that has
made it necessary for her to keep her head bandaged.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the other, obviously puzzled, “I do
not understand you. I did not know she had any
ear trouble, and I have never seen her with a bandage.”</p>

<p>It was the teacher’s turn to be astonished. She
could not believe that the girl had been deceiving her;
but, to get at the truth, she decided to take her immediately
to the hospital where the operation was
supposed to have been performed. There the child
made her way about as if perfectly familiar with the
place, and greeted in a friendly manner the surgeon
in charge. He, however, did not seem to recognise
her, and when told the circumstances by the teacher,
said:</p>

<p>“I can assure you I have never operated upon this
girl.”</p>

<p>He then made a thorough examination of her ear,
and found it to be quite sound. After which, careful
investigation developed the fact that her sole knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>edge
of the hospital was derived from detailed information
given her by a friend, a lady who, curiously
enough, had been operated upon a little while previously
for precisely the trouble that the girl had attributed
to herself.</p>

<p>In other words, no doubt remained that she had
for weeks been acting a lie, from what motive neither
her teacher nor her parents could fathom.</p>

<p>Again, a clergyman writing to the Society for
Psychical Research from a little English village
named Ham, urgently requested the despatch of a
skilled investigator to look into certain strange occurrences
in the house of a Mr. Turner. This house,
the clergyman asserted, was haunted by a “veritable
ghost,” which amused itself by playing all sorts of
mischievous and annoying pranks.</p>

<p>Remaining invisible, it hurled boots, shoes, and
other small objects through the air, upset chairs and
tables, and on at least one occasion it had pitched
the family cat into the fire. All this was done, according
to both the clergyman and several other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>telligent
eye-witnesses, under circumstances that rendered
it impossible that the “manifestations” could
be the work of any human agency.</p>

<p>“No one can explain it,” the clergyman declared.
“It is quite a mystery, and is causing great excitement
through the countryside.”</p>

<p>The task of laying this “poltergeist,” or troublesome
ghost, was assigned to Mr. Ernest Westlake,
an able psychical researcher. Proceeding to Ham,
he found that the Turner family consisted of Mr.
Turner, his wife, one son, and a deformed little
daughter, Polly, not quite twelve years old. So impressed
was he with what he heard that his first report
indicated a belief that the phenomena witnessed might
be genuine evidences of some mysterious and unknown
force. But, after a few hours of watchful scrutiny,
he sent word that “the Ham ghost is a humbug <em>now</em>,
whatever it may have been.” In detail Mr. Westlake
afterward added:</p>

<p>“After posting my first letter, I went to the
Turners’ and sat on a bench in front of the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
No one else was present besides the child. She sat on
a low stool in the chimney on the right of the fire.
On the other side of the hearth there was a brick oven
in which, much to Polly’s interest, I placed a dish of
flour, arguing that a power capable of discharging
the contents of the oven (one of the first disturbances)
might be able to impress the flour. After a
time I went to the oven to see how the flour was getting
on, stooping slightly to look in; but I kept my
eye on the child’s hands, looking at them under my
right arm. I saw her hand stealing down toward a
stick that was projecting from the fire; I moved
slightly, and the hand was withdrawn. Next time I
was careful to make no movement, and saw her hand
jerk the brand out on to the floor. She cried out.
I expressed interest and astonishment; and her
mother came in and cleared up the debris.</p>

<p>“This was repeated several times, and one or two
large sticks ready for burning, which stood near the
child, was thrown down. Then a kettle that was
hanging on a hook and chain was jerked off the hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
on to the coals. This was repeated. As the kettle
refused to stay on its hook, the mother placed it on
the hearth; but it was soon overturned on to the
floor. After this, I was sitting on the bench that
stood facing the fire in front of the table. I had
placed my hat on the table behind me. The little
girl was standing near me on my right hand. Presently
the hat was thrown down on to the ground. I
did not on the first occasion see the girl’s movements;
but later, by seeming to look in another direction, I
saw her hand sweep the hat off on to the floor. This
I saw at least twice. A Windsor chair near the girl
was then upset more than once, falling away from
her. On one occasion I saw her push the chair over
with both hands. As she was looking away from me,
I got a nearly complete view. After one of these
performances, the mother came in and asked the child
if she had done it; but the latter denied it.” (<cite>Proceedings
of the Society for Psychical Research</cite>, vol.
xii.)</p>

<p>Unquestionably, Mr. Westlake concluded, Polly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
was the “ghost.” Yet he found it difficult to conjecture
why she should have assumed so singular a
rôle. Neither she nor her parents—whom he exonerated
from all complicity—had profited a
penny’s worth from her exploits. Indeed, her parents
had been put out of pocket by the damage to the
household furniture and utensils.</p>

<p>Consider, also, the case of a little Chicago boy who
had fallen out of a play-wagon and hurt one of his
arms. The injury was in reality very slight; but
his mother, becoming greatly alarmed, declared her
belief that the doctor would say the arm was broken.
What the doctor—D’Orsay Hecht, of Northwestern
University Medical School—did say was that a few
applications of witch-hazel would speedily remedy
matters.</p>

<p>The mother, nevertheless, insisted on bandaging
the arm, talked of having an X-ray examination, and
broadly hinted that a wrong diagnosis had been made.
Within a few days, as Doctor Hecht had expected,
all signs of injury disappeared. But now the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
complained that the hand of the injured arm felt
stiff; and, in a day or so, his mother reported that
both hand and arm were paralysed.</p>

<p>This was the situation when, passing along the
street one day, Doctor Hecht was astonished and
amused to see his “paralysed” patient romping with
a number of children, quite as if nothing were the
matter with him. He used his injured arm freely,
pushed and pulled his playmates, and was pushed and
pulled around by them.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought the physician, with a feeling of relief,
“evidently this youngster is going to give no
more trouble.”</p>

<p>He was mistaken. Within a week the mother sent
for him, reporting that her boy was suffering agonies,
that he could not eat, and that his arm had become
contracted at the elbow. In fact, on visiting the boy
he found that at every attempt to flex the arm the
little fellow screamed with pain.</p>

<p>But on his next visit, when the child chanced to be
asleep, Doctor Hecht noticed that there was then no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
contracture of the arm, and that he could move it
without disturbing the boy in the slightest. So soon,
however, as he awoke, the contracture returned, and
he wailed and shrieked when his arm was touched.
To the astonished mother, the doctor said:</p>

<p>“I see what the trouble is. Your son needs a certain
kind of treatment that I can administer only at
my office. Bring him there as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The treatment in question consisted in the application
of a succession of slight electrical shocks, just
painful enough to be felt. These, the doctor assured
the boy, would cure him completely.</p>

<p>“If they do not,” said he, “your mother must
bring you back, and I will give you a stronger treatment
next time. I don’t think, though, that that
will be necessary, do you?”</p>

<p>And, in point of fact, no second treatment was
needed. From that moment the boy ceased complaining
of his arm, the contracture and paralysis entirely
disappeared, and he was like any normal, healthy
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>I have cited these three cases, not because of their
singularity, but because they afford concrete illustration
of some little known facts with which every
parent ought to be acquainted. In each case, it will
be observed, an element of deception was present;
and, moreover, in each case the deception was seemingly
motiveless. The child who pretended that she
had been operated upon had apparently nothing to
gain from the deceit practised by her; neither had
the little girl who played the part of a “poltergeist,”
nor the boy with the sham contracture and paralysis.
Besides which, in two of the three cases the children
subjected themselves to considerable inconvenience
and even pain; and, in all three cases, they ran the
risk of severe punishment. None the less, they systematically
and persistently kept up their deceptions
until discovery ensued.</p>

<p>Now, why did they do it?</p>

<p>They did it, as recent medical and psychological
investigation into the inner life of childhood has conclusively
demonstrated, because they were so consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>tuted
that they could not help doing it. And for the
same reason, hundreds—nay, thousands—of children,
before and since, have been doing much the
same thing. It is not that they are merely
“naughty.” The ordinary naughty child will, to be
sure, lie and cheat and otherwise deceive; but only
from readily ascertainable motives, and never in the
way of an elaborately sustained deception. When a
child’s “naughtiness” takes this latter form, medical
authorities are to-day agreed, it is in reality indicative
of the presence of a really serious disease—hysteria.</p>

<p>Than this disease—of which most people, unfortunately,
have next to no exact knowledge, mistakenly
confusing it with, and confining it to, uncontrollable
attacks of weeping or laughing—there is
no malady more insidious, peculiar, or dangerous in
the variety of its possible consequences. Its peculiarity
lies in the fact—discovered only within
recent years—that it is always rooted in an extreme
“suggestibility” on the part of its victims; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the symptoms it develops are invariably conditioned
by the character of the suggestions received from the
environment. Hysteria is, to put the case briefly,
pre-eminently a mental trouble; and this although,
not infrequently, its only outward manifestations are
wholly physical.</p>

<p>A child with a hysterical tendency—that is to
say, an unusually sensitive, impressionable child, of
undisciplined will, and quickly overwhelmed by whatever
it sees, hears, or feels—is always liable, when
brought into contact with a person suffering from
any serious ailment of picturesque symptomatology,
to manifest in some degree the symptoms of that particular
ailment. Or, more commonly, such a child
may manifest grave physical disabilities simply as a
result of hearing or reading about them.</p>

<p>It does not do this voluntarily; there is no conscious
intention to deceive; for the matter of that,
the child itself is as much deceived as are its parents
and friends. The trouble is that in its state of abnormal
suggestibility, it is irresistibly impelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the strange power of self-suggestion to imitate the
symptoms of disease.</p>

<p>Or, instead of simulating disease symptoms, a hysterical
child may enter on a course of seemingly deliberate
chicanery like that practised by little “poltergeist”
Polly Turner, whose case is typical of a
species of behaviour indulged in by hysterical children
in all countries and all ages. Here, likewise,
abnormal suggestibility is in evidence, the resultant
hysterical manifestations differing only because the
suggestions received and acted on are different.</p>

<p>In cases like Polly Turner’s, it has been found,
the hysterical child usually lives with people more or
less superstitious and credulous. They are people
inclined to attribute to some spiritistic agency any
occurrence they cannot easily explain. In this environment
the child gradually becomes obsessed—though
quite unconsciously—with a desire to provide
“marvels” for their edification and mystification,
and, yielding to the desire, is soon in full career
as a “poltergeist,” the hysterical obsession becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
intensified in proportion as the gullibility of those
deceived increases, and also in proportion to the
amount of attention paid to the little deceiver.</p>

<p>For—and this is a point to be borne well in mind—it
is not alone abnormal suggestibility that characterises
the hysterical child. There is also present an
abnormal craving to attract attention, to be a centre
of interest. Of this craving, as of the deceits carried
out to attain its realisation, the child itself is unconscious.
But it may be stated with assurance that it
invariably exists as a concomitant of hysteria. Ordinarily
it is the family and intimate friends whose
interest and sympathy the child wishes to arouse,
though this is not always the case. There may be
special reasons for desiring to impress mere acquaintances,
or even absolute strangers. Then we have the
odd spectacle of children, like the pupil in the German
school, whose hysterical obsessions appear chiefly or
only in the presence of outsiders, while the parents
remain in partial or total ignorance of them.</p>

<p>And, speaking of this type of hysteria, I may say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
that I am acquainted with a young New York woman
who, since the age of fifteen, has led many an unsuspecting
physician a merry dance by reason of her extraordinary
hysterical simulations. In early girlhood
she began to complain of various ailments, which
on examination proved to be of no moment. Not
unnaturally her family lost patience with her
“whims,” as they called them, and regarded her as
a wholly imaginary invalid. Like most people similarly
situated, they utterly failed to appreciate that,
as has been well said by Doctor Pierre Janet, one of
the world’s foremost authorities on hysteria, “When
a person is so ill that he says he is ill when he is not
ill at all, then he must be very ill indeed.” They
scolded the girl, they argued with her; but they made
no attempt to give her the treatment she really
needed.</p>

<p>What was the consequence? One day she mysteriously
disappeared from home, and some time
passed before she was located in a hospital, where
preparations were making to perform an operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
upon her for appendicitis. A little later she wandered
off again, and turned up at another hospital
with symptoms so closely resembling a tumorous
growth that a diagnosis to that effect was made, and
an immediate operation advised. Still later an eminent
specialist was misled into crediting her with a
serious spinal disease.</p>

<p>After this it was decided that she was insane, and
the family had her committed to an asylum. Before
her release she developed symptoms of ear trouble so
pronounced that the dangerous mastoid operation
would have been performed had not the superintendent
of the asylum been informed of her previous adventures
as a hospital visitant.</p>

<p>Manifestly, a disease that both impels and enables
its victims to mimic the symptoms of grave organic
affections, with such verisimilitude as to deceive even
physicians, is an extremely serious affair. And one
has only to inquire of doctors with an extensive hospital
experience to learn that hysteria, in one form
or another, is a widespread trouble among both chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>dren
and adults. But it is no longer the bugbear of
the medical profession that it used to be. Following
the discovery of its essentially mental character,
methods have been devised and perfected for handling
it. Some of these seem absurdly simple, but even
the simplest have been proved efficacious, especially in
the case of children. Differing in detail, they have
one feature in common. They directly attack the
hysterical symptoms by the employment of the same
agency that was provocative of them—namely, suggestion.</p>

<p>In the case of the boy with the pseudo paralysis,
reported above, it was not any therapeutic virtue inherent
in the electrical treatment that brought about
his rapid restoration to health. It was simply the
suggestive efficacy of the way in which the treatment
was administered to him. The truth of this, however,
may be made clearer by the citation of one or
two other cases, that are also of interest as illustrating
the ingenious devices by which hysterical attacks
in the period of childhood are nowadays overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>There was brought to a New England neurologist
a little girl of ten, suffering from a curious physical
abnormality. As long as she was seated, there
seemed to be little the matter with her; but the moment
she attempted to stand her feet bent under her
so that they would not support her weight. When
left alone she swayed backward and forward, and then
fell on her hands and knees. In addition to this,
there was a complete paralysis of the left arm, the
child thus being deprived of the use of three of her
four limbs.</p>

<p>Questioned by the physician, her mother explained
that these muscular troubles had first set in six
months before, following an attack of measles, and
that her condition had grown progressively worse.
This pointed to an organic and incurable malady;
and, indeed, the mother was firmly convinced that
nothing could be done. But, on making some delicate
diagnostic tests, no signs of true organic trouble
were to be found; whereas there were some indications
that the disability might be wholly functional,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the result of hysteria. In verification of his suspicion
the physician made a few experiments which
proved that the child was extremely suggestible.
Turning to her mother, he said:</p>

<p>“You are quite wrong in supposing that your
daughter cannot be cured. She is ill, it is true; but
her illness is of such a nature that it will quickly respond
to the right kind of treatment.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested the mother, incredulous, “she
cannot use her legs, she cannot move her arm.”</p>

<p>“No matter. I have something here that will enable
her to use her legs and move her arm.”</p>

<p>He took up a large magnet and showed it to the
little girl. She watched him with the keenest interest,
while he used it to lift several pieces of iron.</p>

<p>“Now look,” said he.</p>

<p>Holding it over his left hand, he slowly raised that
hand until it touched the magnet, pretending that it
had been drawn up exactly as the pieces of iron had
been.</p>

<p>“You see the power of this instrument,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
to the wondering child. “It can move your arm,
and give strength to your legs and feet, in the very
same way.”</p>

<p>For three weeks the magnet was applied to the different
muscles, with the suggestion that the limbs
would thereby regain their power. Nine treatments
in all were given. After the ninth treatment the girl
walked into the doctor’s office unaided.</p>

<p>“Yesterday,” her mother explained, “she told me
that she thought her arm felt better, and she found
that she could raise it. Then she said she believed
she could walk; and, getting out of bed, she crossed
the room without the least assistance, and without
her feet clubbing under her. Can it be, Doctor, that
she is cured?”</p>

<p>In fact, she was cured; although, of course, the
magnet itself had had no power to cure her, but was
used merely as an agent for an efficient “counter-suggestion”
to dislodge and uproot the symptom-producing
suggestions in the girl’s own mind.</p>

<p>Excellent results have also been obtained in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
cases of hysterical paralysis among children by the
use of what is known as the “method of surprise,”
the invention of a German specialist named Bruns.
As employed by Doctor Bruns and his followers, this
method has undoubtedly a certain aspect of brutality;
but this is more than compensated by its effectiveness.
Having determined, by a searching medical
examination, that the paralysis in any given case is
functional and not organic, what Bruns does is to
place the paralysed child in a bath-tub, turn on the
cold water faucet, and watch the youngster climb out
and scamper off.</p>

<p>“You see,” he then says to him, at this psychological
moment, “you can walk very well, after all. Now
let us hear no more from you about being unable to
walk.”</p>

<p>If for any reason he deems the bath-tub device inadvisable,
his plan is to put the child to bed, keep it
entirely isolated, and deprive it of all food for a day
or so. An appetising meal is then brought into the
room, and left some distance from the child’s bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Frequently this is all that is needed to effect a cure.
The suggestion of food overcoming the suggestion of
paralysis, the child gets out of bed and starts across
the room, being encountered midway by Bruns, who—of
course by accident—enters the room at that precise
instant, and makes use of verbal suggestion to
reinforce and maintain the “miraculous” recovery.</p>

<p>In contrast with this method of surprise is the
“method of disregard,” also originated by Bruns and
used by him in cases of hysteria other than those involving
muscular paralysis—cases, for example, of
obsessions, facial “tics,” spasms, or convulsive seizures.
In employing the method of disregard the little
patient is carefully watched by doctor and nurses
but in such a manner that he is led to believe they
are paying scarcely any attention to him. As a result
the idea that, despite his own conviction, his
malady must be most insignificant, gradually takes
increasing possession of him, and in proportion as it
does so the hysterical symptoms disappear.</p>

<p>But, the reader may ask, does this truly mean that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the hysteria itself has been cured? Do not these
methods, one and all, achieve merely the removal of
symptoms? Is not the child still suggestible enough
to develop a new variety of hysterical disturbances
should occasion arise?</p>

<p>Such objections are not without force, though in
practice it has been observed that the cure of the
symptoms by suggestion does actually seem to weaken
the tendency to future hysterical outbreaks of any
kind. To be on the safe side, however, it is always
well to institute environmental changes of a sort that
will make for a constantly closer approach by the
child to a normal life.</p>

<p>With this, we come to the point that is of supreme
interest to parents.</p>

<p>Almost without exception it is in the home that the
seeds are sown which may afterward bear the bitter
fruit of hysteria, whether bearing it in childhood or
not until some critical period comes in later years.
It is the child who is “spoiled,” or kept by unwise
parents in a state of nervous tension and excitement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the child whose sense of moral responsibility is not
properly developed, and whose natural suggestibility
is unduly heightened by the superstitions, fears, and
eccentricities of its elders; it is such a child who,
soon or late, may be counted on to manifest some
hysterical taint, perhaps not of the extreme type
illustrated by the cases narrated above, but nevertheless
of a sort making against happiness, usefulness,
and success in the world of active effort. Or, to
state the situation in more detail in the words of a
physician of my acquaintance:</p>

<p>“Hysterical children, it has been my observation,
usually have neurotic parents. At first I was disposed
to see in this another evidence of the dread
workings of heredity. But I am now inclined to the
belief that it illustrates rather the influence of environment.
All children, as you know, are highly
imitative. They tend to copy, with exaggerations,
whatever models are placed before them, and instinctively
they take their parents as their chief models.
If, then, the parents are flighty, excitable, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
rapidly from extreme to extreme of mood, it is only
natural that the children should be likewise. Their
minds undisciplined, their will-power undeveloped,
they easily fall a prey to the baneful, hysteria-producing
suggestions of their unhealthy surroundings.</p>

<p>“To make matters worse, there is often, even
among well-educated persons, an amazing disregard
of the hygienic and dietetic requirements for neural
stability. Children are allowed to sit up to unreasonable
hours; they are permitted altogether too frequent
attendance at parties, theatres, moving-picture
shows, and similar places of entertainment,
where they receive impressions too vivid and varied
for them to absorb easily. Then, too, there is a tendency
to give them at their meals an undue allowance
of meat, and to permit them to drink tea, coffee, and
other stimulants making for nerve disturbance.</p>

<p>“All the while they are living in an atmosphere of
parental uneasiness and unrest. Their mothers—and
perhaps their fathers also—fuss and fume over
them. They delight, it may be, in ‘showing them
off’ to admiring visitors, thus suggesting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
already over-impressionable little ones undue ideas of
their own importance. Presently signs of trouble
appear—restless sleep, ‘night terrors,’ facial
‘tics,’ possibly even full-blown attacks of hysterical
convulsions, paralysis, deafness, or what not—and
the neurologist has another patient on his hands.”</p>

<p>Surely the duty of parents is plain. To set before
their children from earliest infancy examples of
placidity and strength of character, to educate their
will no less than their intellect, to guard them as far
as possible from all harmful suggestions, to love them
without idolising them, to study carefully their physical
as well as their mental and moral needs—in this
way, and in this way alone, can safety be had against
the dread evil of hysteria and allied nervous troubles.
Especially is such a course indispensable in view of
the now well-demonstrated fact that a faulty upbringing
may be primarily responsible for mental and
nervous maladies, not of childhood but of adult life,
and of a character to challenge the utmost skill of
the best trained physicians. Of this, more in our
next chapter.</p>

THE MENACE OF FEAR</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>  have no intention of describing the ordinary,
familiar phenomena of fear. These, in both
their psychological and physiological manifestations,
will be found adequately treated in any good
text-book on the emotions. What I wish to do,
rather, is to call attention to some little-known facts
which find scant mention in the text-books for the
excellent reason that it is only within the past few
years that they have been made part of organised
knowledge. Yet they are facts of the utmost significance
from both a theoretical and a practical point
of view; and, indeed, an understanding of them is of
no less importance to the layman than to the scientist.
Their discovery has made possible for the
first time what may be called an applied psychology of
fear—that is to say, a statement of principles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
application of which will go far toward solving the
problem of how to avert the evil consequences of fear
without the loss of its really beneficial qualities.</p>

<p>That there is a certain virtue in fear requires no
scientific demonstration. Fear, as everybody ought
to be aware, is intrinsically one of the most useful
of emotions. It is an instinct implanted in us as a
prime aid in the struggle for existence. Doubtless
for this reason it is, as compared with the other emotions,
the earliest to make its appearance in the newborn
child. Preyer, whose book, “The Mind of the
Child,” is not nearly so well known in this country
as it should be, puts the first manifestation of fear
in an infant at the twenty-third day after birth.
Other observers, including Charles Darwin, have
found no indications of it until somewhat later than
this. But all agree that it is the first emotion, properly
so called, to show itself, and that its normal
function is to instil caution and prudence in relation
to objects and actions that might have destructive
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>The trouble is that fear has a great tendency to
function to excess, especially in the years of childhood,
that formative period which means so much to
future development. There is scarcely one of us
who, looking back, cannot recall some youthful fear,
abnormal in its intensity. Nor are such abnormal
fears confined to the young. With many people they
persist in one form or another throughout life; it
may be as fear of thunder, fear of mice, fear of
snakes. Moreover, they sometimes do not appear
with full force until the period of youth is long past.
At the age of thirty or forty—at any age—there
may develop, with irresistible power, and seemingly
for no reason, a paralysing, appalling fear of doing
some trivial, everyday act, or of coming into contact
with some familiar and entirely harmless object.
When fear becomes as extreme as this it amounts to
a disease, and is recognised as such by the medical
profession, being technically known as a “phobia.”
It is through scientific study of these phobias, as
recently carried out by medical specialists with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
psychological training, that full realisation has been
gained of the tremendous rôle played by fear in the
life of man, and the need for its proper control and
direction.</p>

<p>The two commonest phobias are direct opposites
of one another—namely, fear of open places (agoraphobia)
and fear of being in a closed place (claustrophobia).
The victim of agoraphobia can with difficulty
be persuaded to trust himself outdoors. He
fears that if he goes out some catastrophe will overwhelm
him. His state of mind is one of absolute
panic, and when obliged to cross any open space,
such as a public park, he displays all the symptoms
of extreme fear. The person troubled with abnormal
fear of closed places experiences no difficulty of this
sort. He is, on the contrary, never so happy as when
in the open. His troubles begin when he is asked to
take, say, a drive in a cab or a journey in a railway
car. He dare not attend the theatre, or any indoor
public entertainment. Whence comes his aversion
from closed places he cannot say. He only knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
that the mere thought of being in any place from
which he cannot escape at a moment’s notice fills him
with a torturing dread.</p>

<p>In accounting for phobias like these psychologists
have, as a usual thing, fallen back on pure theory,
and—especially when strongly influenced by the evolutionary
doctrine—have been wont to attribute
them to the emergence of ancestral traits and instincts
once of real biological value. But recent investigation
has made it certain that this ancestral
revival theory is both superfluous and erroneous, and
tends to hinder rather than help an understanding of
the mechanism and consequences of fear. For one
thing, there is the fact that agoraphobia and
claustrophobia are not the only irrational fears.
There may be a phobia for any conceivable act or
object, and to explain all these in terms of the revival
of ancestral instincts is surely beyond the power
of the most vivid scientific imagination. Further
than this, so far as abnormal fear of open or closed
spaces is concerned, the researches of the medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
specialists have rendered possible a satisfactory explanation—and
an explanation that has much practical
value—without harking back to the feelings
and doings of primitive man.</p>

<p>It has been found in every case scientifically studied
that there is indeed a memory revival of past experiences,
but that it is invariably a revival of experiences
in the life of the victim himself, not of his
remote ancestors. This is true of every kind of
phobia. The sufferer may honestly declare his inability
to recall any antecedent happening of a fear-inducing
character. But it is found that, subconsciously
at any rate, he always carries with him a
vivid memory-image of some occurrence that at the
time shocked him greatly; and that his phobia is due
to the ceaseless presentation in his subconsciousness
of this vivid memory-image. In proof of which may
be cited the experiences of any medical man accustomed,
in treating patients for nervous and mental
troubles, to make use of modern methods—hyp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>notism,
hynoidisation, and so forth—for exploring
the obscurer workings of the human mind.</p>

<p>Take, by way of illustration, a case of abnormal
fear of open places successfully treated by Doctor
Isador H. Coriat, a Boston neurologist of my acquaintance.
The patient was a young man who for
nearly two years had been tormented by an irrational
fear of fields, parks, and public squares. His relatives
and friends had argued with him, he had tried
to conquer the phobia by force of will, but all to no
purpose. Nor could he give any reason for his abnormal
dread.</p>

<p>Put into the hypnotic state, however, and questioned
again, he recalled an incident that at once revealed
its source. Two years previously, it appeared,
he had been taking a horseback ride, when he unexpectedly
galloped into an open field.</p>

<p>“I became terribly frightened,” said he, “as the
ground was rough, and I thought I should certainly
fall off the horse. I felt faint, my heart beat rap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>idly,
I broke into a cold perspiration and trembled
all over. It seemed as if the end of the world was
coming. Since then, whenever I see a field or a park
I am reminded of this, and feel the same agonising
fear.”</p>

<p>In the case of another patient suffering from fear
of closed spaces the abnormal fear was traced to an
occasion when, visiting a friend in a small, close room,
the patient had a fainting attack. In a third patient,
a young woman, there developed a fear of
crowds because, some time previously, at a crowded
school celebration, she had been slightly overcome by
heat, and had “felt like screaming.” Another young
woman was afflicted with pyrophobia, or fear of fire,
in such an extreme form that she could not remain in
a room where an open fire was burning, and every
night made the rounds of her house to satisfy herself
there was nothing that could start a conflagration.
Inquiry showed that all this morbid anxiety was an
outgrowth of a previous experience with fire.</p>

<p>Sometimes memory of the antecedent causal experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>ence
is not entirely blotted out of the upper consciousness.
The sufferer may even entertain a clear
recollection of it and still be unable to conquer his
phobia; which, however, under these circumstances is
not nearly so severe as when the process is entirely
one of subconscious mentation. In either case, of
course, the problem of the development of the phobia
still requires explanation. Only partial enlightenment
is gained, after all, when we recognise the causal
action of some specific occurrence, such as a fall, a
fainting-fit, or the sight of a fire. Thousands of
persons experience these things without thereby becoming
victims of a phobia. When a phobia does
result, some exceptional circumstances must be operative,
and it is manifestly desirable to learn, if possible,
what these are.</p>

<p>It is the more desirable since, as investigation is
daily revealing more and more clearly, abnormal
dread is not the only malady resulting from a fear-occasioning
event. Where one man, as the result of
a sudden fright, may in course of time become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
phobiac, another may develop symptoms, not of
mental trouble, but of bodily disease. A most instructive
instance is afforded by the experiences of a
young Russian immigrant in this country who had
the good fortune to come under the observation of
those two eminent specialists in the treatment of
mentally-caused disorders, Doctors Morton Prince
and Boris Sidis.</p>

<p>The trouble for which this young man sought relief
was, to all appearance, purely physical. It consisted
of periodic convulsive attacks that racked the
right half of his body, and had led to a diagnosis of
epilepsy. Since sundry delicate symptoms characteristic
of epilepsy were absent, however, the specialists,
after a careful study of the case, came to the
conclusion that the spasms from which their patient
suffered might involve no true organic disease, and
might be nothing more than the outward manifestation
of some deep-seated psychical disturbance.
With this possibility in mind they questioned him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
both in the normal waking state and in hypnosis, and
brought to light some interesting facts.</p>

<p>The first attack, he told them, had set in five years
before, when he was sixteen years old and living in
Russia. After returning from a dance one evening,
he went back to look for a ring lost by the young
lady whom he had escorted home. It was past midnight,
and his way lay over a country road by a
cemetery. Nearing the cemetery, he thought he
heard somebody or something running after him. He
turned to flee, fell, and lost consciousness. He still
was unconscious when found on the road. After he
had been brought to, it was seen that he was afflicted
with a spasmodic, uncontrollable shaking of the right
side, involving his head, arm, and leg. This lasted
almost a week, when he seemed as well as ever. But
every year thereafter, at about the same time, he had
had an attack similar in all respects to the first one,
excepting only that he did not become unconscious.</p>

<p>He further declared, while in the hypnotic state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
that throughout the period of the attacks he had unpleasant
dreams, all relating to the fright and fall of
five years before. In these dreams he lived over and
over again the experience from which his trouble
dated.</p>

<p>“I find myself,” said he, “on the lonely road in
my little native town. I am hurrying along the road
near the cemetery. It is very dark. I imagine
somebody—a robber, or a ghost—is running after
me. I become frightened, call for help, and fall.
Then I wake up with a start, and remember nothing
about the dream. I no longer am afraid, but I have
these terrible spasms.”</p>

<p>It was even found possible to produce the convulsive
attacks experimentally by simply reminding him,
while hypnotised, of the incident on the road. To
Doctors Prince and Sidis it now seemed certain that
his malady was due to nothing else than the persistence
of an intensely vivid subconscious memory-image
of the fright he had experienced; and that he
would no longer be troubled by it if the memory-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>image
were destroyed by psychotherapeutic treatment.
Suggestions to this effect were accordingly
given him, when awake as well as when hypnotised.
The outcome was all that could be desired, for a
speedy and permanent cure was brought about.</p>

<p>Paralysis, muscular contractures, symptoms mimicking
tuberculosis, kidney disease, and other dread
organic maladies, are also recognised to-day as possible
after-effects, through the power of subconscious
mental action, of happenings that give rise to a profound
feeling of fear. Sometimes more than one
symptom is thus occasioned in the same patient.
Again, for the purpose of concrete illustration, I
cite a typical case from real life—the case of a Pole,
a man of twenty-five, treated for a weird combination
of mental and physical disturbances.</p>

<p>Physically, he suffered from severe and frequent
attacks of headache, setting in gradually, and preceded
by a feeling of depression and dizziness. During
the attacks his body became cold, his head
throbbed violently, he shivered incessantly. To keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
warm, he was obliged to wrap himself in many blankets.
Mentally, he was tormented by many phobias.
He was afraid of closed places, and still more afraid
of being obliged to remain alone, especially at night.
He had a morbid fear of the dead, and would on no
account enter a room with a corpse in it or attend a
funeral. Nothing could induce him to visit a cemetery,
even in company with other people. Fear of
dogs was also a conspicuous feature of his case, as
was fear of fire.</p>

<p>Through psychological exploration of his subconsciousness,
every one of these symptoms was traced
to actual experiences that had given him great emotional
shocks, and in almost every instance to experiences
that had occurred in his childhood. The
fear of dogs had its origin in an exciting episode he
had had with some dogs when he was only three. The
pyrophobia was connected with the fact that at four
years of age he had been hastily carried from a burning
building, shivering with fright and cold, into the
open air of a frosty night. His dread of cemeteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
and of the dead was rooted in a subconscious recollection
of terrors inspired in him, while a child, by
hearing “all kinds of ghost stories and tales of wandering
lost souls, and of spirits of dead people hovering
about churchyards.”</p>

<p>In addition to this, his mother, a very superstitious
woman, when he was nine, placed the cold hand
of a corpse on his naked chest as a “cure” for some
trifling ailment. Hence his special fear of corpses.
As to the headaches and the sensations of cold, they
were the result partly of this “dead hand” memory,
and partly of the memory of a still more severe experience,
occurring at about the same time, when he
was forced to spend an entire night in a barn in mid-winter,
to escape a party of drunken soldiers who
had beaten his father unmercifully and had killed one
of his little brothers. His fear of closed spaces and
his fear of being alone were associated with the same
experience.</p>

<p>As he grew older much of all this faded from his
conscious recollection. But, by analysing his dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
and questioning him in hypnosis, it was found that
subconsciously he had forgotten none of it. Evidence
also was forthcoming indicating that from time
to time, owing to the occurrence of later experiences
of a less sinister nature but disquieting enough, there
had been exceptionally vivid revivals of the earlier
memories; and that it was in this way that they had
been able to acquire such tremendous disease-producing
power.</p>

<p>Here, I am confident, we have the answer to the
question raised in connection with the development of
phobias in adult life from seemingly trivial occurrences.
Heredity, no doubt, plays some part. But
assuredly a far greater influence is exercised by the
presence of baneful memory-images that need only
an appropriate stimulus to excite them into pernicious
activity. The mechanism of fear-caused diseases,
to put it briefly, is probably much the same as
that operating in the production of the familiar phenomenon
of dreaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>When we dream of anything, we do so because an
incident of the waking life has, through association
of ideas, roused some dormant emotional “complex,”
some group of subconscious ideas relating to matters
which are, or once were, of great significance to us,
and our dream is a symbolic expression of this dormant
complex.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> So is it with the man who suffers
from a fear-induced malady, whether it take the form
of a mental or of a physical disorder.</p>

<p>Perhaps of a neurotic tendency by inheritance,
perhaps of a good heredity, but temporarily weakened
by grief, worry, etc., something occurs that gives this
person a sudden fright, and, by association of ideas,
reminds him, if only subconsciously, of earlier fear-inspiring
episodes in his life. Ordinarily there would
be no unpleasant after-effect, except possibly a few
nights of bad dreams. But in his condition dreaming
is not sufficient to give vent to the subconscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>emotions. Some other channel of discharge must be
found, and it is found in the production of disease-symptoms—whether
mental or physical, or both
mental and physical—symbolising the emotional
complex or complexes stimulated by the happening
that frightened him.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is reason for suspecting that all
functional nervous and mental troubles, no matter
what their immediate cause, are traceable to fear-memories
of remote occurrence, dating usually from
the days of childhood. Certainly it is possible to
detail from recent medical practice innumerable cases
in support of this view. Not to be tedious, I will
give only one or two, selecting first a case of Doctor
Coriat’s, in which the patient, a middle-aged woman,
had for years been tormented by an increasing fear
that she would go insane, and that, if insane, she
would inevitably injure some member of her family.
The poor woman had worn herself out brooding over
this, and was gradually qualifying for commitment to
some institution. But Doctor Coriat could not find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
either in her physical condition or in the facts of her
family history, anything to warrant her belief that
she was doomed to become insane.</p>

<p>Suspecting, therefore, that this belief was merely
a hysterical outgrowth of some forgotten shock in
her previous life, and knowing that in sleep such
latent memories have a tendency to emerge momentarily
into the field of consciousness, he questioned
her regarding the frequency and content of
her dreams.</p>

<p>“I dream a great deal,” she told him, “but I never
have a clear remembrance of what I have dreamed
about.”</p>

<p>Yet, when hypnotised and again questioned regarding
the dreams, she was able to detail many of
them. One in particular interested Doctor Coriat.
It was of a recurrent character, and was identified
by the patient as having first been dreamed at the
time she began to worry over her condition. It was,
in fact, a dream in which she saw herself insane.</p>

<p>“Had anything unpleasant happened to you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
day before you first had that dream?” Doctor Coriat
now inquired of his hypnotised patient.</p>

<p>“Nothing that I can remember, except that I went
to a friend’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“The funeral of a very dear friend?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly—just a friend.”</p>

<p>“But that should not have had such a disturbing
effect on your mind. Did anything happen at the
funeral?”</p>

<p>“I saw a woman there whose eyes frightened
me.”</p>

<p>“And why did they frighten you?”</p>

<p>“Because they reminded me of a preacher I used
to know when I was a little girl. He was a revivalist,
and I always thought he was crazy. I went to his
meetings, and got terribly worked up, and it frightened
me very much. I thought I would go crazy
too, just like the preacher.”</p>

<p>To Doctor Coriat it seemed unnecessary to ask
any more questions. As he saw it, the haunting
dread of insanity was nothing but the continuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
in consciousness of the forgotten memory of the
childhood fright, revived by subconscious association
of the woman at the funeral with the preacher whose
rabid exhortations had inspired the patient with
such terror. On this theory he utilised the resources
of medical psychology to deprive the baneful memory-image
of its power to harm, and soon had the satisfaction
of being able to record a perfect cure.</p>

<p>In another case, successfully treated by Doctor
Sidis, the subconscious persistence of childhood fears
actually threatened a young woman with perhaps
lifelong confinement in an asylum for the insane.
She had, in fact, been placed in a New York hospital
for observation, and it was there that Doctor Sidis
treated her. According to her relatives, who did
not doubt that she had lost her reason, she suffered
from strange hallucinations, particularly of constantly
hearing voices call to her, and of being killed.
She even imagined at times that she was dead, and
would lie in a cataleptic condition, rigidly motionless.
At other times she complained of a painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
stiffness in her arms, and of difficulty in walking.</p>

<p>Testing her psychologically, Doctor Sidis found
cause for thinking that her trouble was hysterical
rather than a true insanity involving brain lesions,
and he promptly questioned her relatives regarding
her previous history. She had had, he learned, some
exceedingly unpleasant experiences with a brother-in-law,
a rough, brutal fellow, but they did not seem
adequate to account for her various symptoms.
These, he suspected, had their roots farther back in
her life, and, although she professed a total inability
to recall any severe fright or worry other than those
associated with her brother-in-law, he remained unshaken
in his suspicion.</p>

<p>“What do you dream about?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly know,” she replied. “I am sure
I dream a good deal, though, for when I wake I always
seem to have been dreaming, and to have had
horrid dreams. All I can say is that I dimly remember
seeing in them many ugly faces.”</p>

<p>“Is your brother-in-law’s face among them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and other people’s faces. But I’m sure I
don’t know who they are.”</p>

<p>Subjected to a special process of “mind tunneling”
of Doctor Sidis’s own invention, the patient
recalled a number of dreams in vivid detail. Most of
them showed a strong resemblance to one another, in
that they had as their setting a forest, and as their
chief actors men of repulsive aspect, usually dressed
in the roughest of clothing, and usually intent on
capturing the dreamer. Only the night before, she
declared, she had dreamed that a man was trying to
choke her, and she had awakened panic-stricken, and
so drenched with perspiration that her nurse—who
corroborated her statement—had had to change her
night-gown.</p>

<p>“Can you identify the men of your dreams—the
men dressed in rough clothing who pursue you so
fiercely?” Doctor Sidis asked, while she still was in
the artificial state into which he had put her.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she answered, much agitated. “I
know them only too well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>Now, for the first time, she related to him two
most significant episodes of her girlhood. Once, it
appeared, when she was hardly nine years old, she
was walking along a country road, past a forest,
when a wood-cutter—“a big man, with big arms
and hands projecting from short sleeves”—tried to
catch her and carry her into the forest. “He ran
after me with outstretched arms. I screamed, and
ran from him as fast as I could, calling for help all
the time.” And, on another occasion, when she was
even younger—only six—on her way to school
through the woods, a man met her, gave her candy,
talked to her nicely, and all at once seized her so
roughly that she began to scream with fright and
pain. At that moment somebody came along, and
the man released her and fled.</p>

<p>These were the men whom she chiefly saw in her
dreams; these were the shocks which, aggravated by
the more recent experiences of a not dissimilar sort
with her brother-in-law, were the true determinants
of her hysteria—as was proved by the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
upon psychological disintegration of her subconscious
memories of them, a speedy and lasting return
to health resulted.</p>

<p>In like manner the seemingly epileptic attacks of
a nineteen-year-old New York “street arab” were
found to be nothing more than the external manifestation
of subconscious memory-images, dating
back to early childhood, of nights passed in a dark,
damp, terror-inspiring cellar. The sight of the discoloured
corpse of a man who had died from cholera
left in the mind of a sensitive girl of ten such a painful
impression that years afterward, quite unaccountably
as it seemed, she developed an abnormal fear of
contracting some deadly disease; and had she not
fortunately been taken to a skilled medical psychologist
(Doctor Pierre Janet) she would almost certainly
have ended her days in an asylum. In the
case of an over-worked Boston young man, thought
to be suffering from “dementia praecox,” it was
found that his morbid notion that he had committed
an “unpardonable sin” was only a hysterical product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of subconsciously remembered fears of childhood.
The victim himself eventually recognised this, declaring,
in an autobiographical statement made at
his physician’s request:</p>

<p>“My abnormal fear certainly originated from doctrines
of hell which I heard in early childhood, particularly
from a rather ignorant elderly woman who
taught Sunday-school. My early religious thought
was chiefly concerned with the direful eternity of
torture that might be awaiting me if I was not good
enough to be saved.”</p>

<p>Whether or no all cases of functional nervous and
mental disease are thus rooted in emotional stresses
of youth, certainly this is often enough the fact to
constitute a serious warning to all who have anything
to do with the upbringing of the young. If fears of
childhood can persist throughout life and can affect
adult development so profoundly as to be causal
agents in the production of disease, it is obvious that
parents and educators should adopt every means in
their power to prevent the growth of unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
fears in the little ones in their care. Yet, as matters
are to-day, and not least in the home, most children
are subject to influences that tend to foster,
not inhibit, such fears.</p>

<p>In their presence, as was noted on a previous page,
parents often discuss accidents, crimes, sensational
doings of all sorts; they betray a fretfulness, an
anxiety, an unrest, that cannot but react on the
sensitive mind of the child, filling it with fears of it
knows not what; they even utilise the fear impulse
as a means of coercing the child into good behaviour;
and, what is perhaps worst of all, many parents intrust
their children to ignorant and superstitious
nurses, who take a strange pleasure in “scaring them
half to death” with tales of demons, ghosts and goblins.</p>

<p>Fortunately the majority of people, as a result of
later training and experience, or by the exercise of
will-power, are able to suppress the fears of childhood;
but often only at the cost of great mental torture.
Not so long ago I received a letter from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Detroit business man, Mr. John J. Mitchell, that may
well be quoted in this connection. He wrote:</p>

<p>“As a child, as far back as memory goes, I was
‘afraid of the dark,’ intensely afraid.... At about
eleven years of age I got a place in a country store,
and perhaps two years later changed to the largest
store in town. This concern did a large, old-fashioned
country business, buying produce and selling
all manner of merchandise in exchange or on credit.
This involved the use of two old-time buildings
(frame) with three stories each and a cellar under
all. Owing to the character of the business and location,
there were doors opening to the street and
area on each side and rear from every floor, including
the cellar, seven or eight in all, and widely apart,
besides windows. It was my duty at dusk to see that
all these doors were properly closed and barred for
the night.... With my childish fear of the dark
this daily task was an ordeal—at times a terrible
ordeal.</p>

<p>“I never made complaint or confided my fears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
a soul. But for some reason, the source of which
was, and is, as obscure as my intangible fears, I resolved
to cure myself of this terror.... My plan,
adopted and unflinchingly carried out, was to compel
myself—a slender, timid little kid—to go that
round daily, in the shadowy dusk, without a light
(which I was privileged to have, a lantern). I can
only remember now the <em>pain</em> of dread and unreasoning
apprehension, and the resolution to ‘have it over
and done with.’</p>

<p>“I cannot now fix the time when it was accomplished,
but in the end I was completely cured, so
that, at least since my majority, I have not only been
relieved of this dread, but I often welcome the folds
of darkness (of night), as if wrapped about with a
comforting garment. It will be a certain qualification
to state that, at very long intervals, and always
after some physical or mental strain, I feel momentarily
a fear of return of old impressions in ‘uncanny’
surroundings.”</p>

<p>And, beyond any question, no matter how effectu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>ally
one may suppress such youthful fears, so far as
relates to their survival in the upper consciousness,
there will always be a subconscious remnant, a buried
complex, ready to emerge and work mischief in one
way or another. There is a world of truth in Professor
Angelo Mosso’s emphatic declaration:</p>

<p>“Every ugly thing told to the child, every shock,
every fright given him, will remain like minute splinters
in the flesh, to torture him all his life long.”</p>

<p>If not in such an extreme form as a phobia, or
other functional disease, the early fears will nevertheless
make their presence felt in later life. In
some men they may engender lack of self-confidence,
and even a despicable cowardice; in others they may
breed superstitious terrors and usages. Always, in
some way, one may depend on it, they will affect the
character, the intellect, the whole moral and mental
make-up.</p>

<p>Nor will their influence be confined to the individual.
Fear, as every psychologist knows, is one of
the most contagious of the emotions. Socially, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
well as individually, it has a useful function to perform.
The presence in all civilised communities of
police and fire departments, boards of health, and
the like, testifies impressively to the influence of social
fear working normally as a conserving agent.
But there may be, and frequently is, social as well as
individual abnormality of fear; as in panics, massacres,
lynchings. In order to deal with this effectually,
in order to keep social fear within the bounds
of reason, it will always be necessary to recognise
that, after all, society is made up of a mass of individuals,
and can only think and feel and act as individuals
think and feel and act. Train the individual
properly, and society will be sane and healthy and
efficient enough.</p>

<h2>IX<br /><br />

A FEW CLOSING WORDS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e have now reviewed in some detail the
principal results of recent psychological
research and observation, so far
as these bear directly on man’s mental and moral
growth. Varied as is the mass of information thus
brought together, we have found it pointing uniformly
to one conclusion—the transcendent significance
of the environmental influences of early life.</p>

<p>Again and again we have found confirmation of the
view that what a man is and does depends, as a rule,
not so much on the gifts or defects of his heredity as
on the excellences or shortcomings of his childhood’s
training and surroundings. If these are favourable,
even the dead hand of a bad inheritance may be arrested,
and he may develop surprising strength
of intellect and character; if unfavourable, mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and moral inferiority may be looked for, no matter
how good the heredity.</p>

<p>This, of course, emphasises the responsibilities of
parenthood, chief among which, as would appear
from the facts surveyed, are the beginning of formal
education in the home, the providing of a carefully
planned material environment, and the setting of a
really good example. There can be no doubt, to
return for a moment to the superlatively instructive
case of Karl Witte, that by all odds the greatest
force in the moral development of that splendid
scholar and gentleman, was the unceasing inspiration
he unconsciously drew from the lives of his father
and mother—from their integrity, unselfishness,
patience, sincerity, and courage. Parents cannot too
soon learn that, to quote a cardinal clause in the elder
Witte’s educational creed:</p>

<p>“Our children are what we are. They are good
when we are good, and bad when we are bad. I would
extend this assertion. With full conviction I would
say, they become clever, magnanimous, modest, witty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
agreeable, amiable, if these are our qualities. They
become the opposite if we precede them with the opposite.”</p>

<p>Or, as Doctor Dubois has so admirably put it in
one of his University of Berne addresses on moral
education:</p>

<p>“You, madam, who complain of the irritability of
your little girl, could you not suppress your own,
which I have seen break out, in a few words exchanged
with your dear husband, immediately afterward?
You, sir, who bitterly reproach your son for his impulsiveness
and instability of temper, have you not
these faults yourself?... Remember the proverb,
‘The fruit does not fall far from the tree.’” (“Reason
and Sentiment,” pp. 53–54.)</p>

<p>Personally, also, I am of Witte’s belief that intellectual
training along the lines followed by him in
his son’s upbringing is of itself an important adjunct
to moral growth. Certainly, by developing the powers
of observation, analysis, and inference, it makes
it easier for the child to appreciate the force of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
arguments advanced by the parent in the way of
direct moral instruction. Besides this, by keeping
the child’s mind occupied with wholesome and profitable
matters, it saves him from the idleness and waste
of energy which, in childhood as much as in adult
life, favour the formation of bad habits. And assuredly
the methods by which his mental education may
best be carried on in the first years of existence are
such that they may be readily applied by all parents.</p>

<p>It is by no means a difficult thing to begin, as
Witte did, by naming to the little one various small
objects in and about the home. These should be
named over and over to him, slowly, clearly, impressively;
and the attempt should next be made to convey
to him a notion of their properties, by teaching
him, for example, to detect differences in colour and
in such qualities as hot and cold, round and square,
hard and soft, rough and smooth. This can be done
in any one of several ways, but the best method, it
seems to me, is that developed within recent years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
by the noted Italian educator of little children, Maria
Montessori.</p>

<p>Her plan with every child whose education is intrusted
to her is to start by teaching it to distinguish
between various touch sensations; and she does this
so successfully that her pupils, aged from three to
seven, are able, blindfolded, to state the differences in
extremely fine gradations of cloths, papers, coins,
and seeds. Any parent can do the same thing, beginning
by drilling the child in distinguishing between
massive sensations, and gradually developing delicacy
of touch.</p>

<p>Two cards, one rough, one smooth, afford an
excellent starting-point. The child touches the
smooth card. “Smooth,” says the parent, and
“Smooth” responds the child. The little fingers
are then placed on the card with the rough surface.
“Rough,” the child is told, and “Rough” he repeats.
Only a few lessons of this sort will be found
necessary to enable him to select at request the
smooth or the rough card and hand it to the parent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Ideas of shape, size, etc., may be similarly imparted,
with the triple advantage that the child will daily,
and without mental stress, acquire a more and more
retentive muscular memory, a more intimate acquaintance
with the facts of the world in which he
lives, and greater observational and reasoning ability.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, the fertilisation of the
child’s mind should also be continued by other educative
measures—as the maintenance of an inspiring
environment, ready and intelligent response to the
child’s innumerable questions, and skilful guidance
of his thoughts to subjects which it is especially
desirable for him to study. The system of walks
and talks, utilised alike by James Thomson, James
Mill, and Pastor Witte, is particularly to be recommended
in this connection, as also Witte’s practice
of propounding to his son interesting problems, and
then taking him to places—factories, mills, etc.—where
he could observe for himself different stages in
their solution.</p>

<p>Something of the same sort is possible to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
parent, who can include in such voyages of discovery,
if he be a city dweller, visits to botanical and zoölogical
gardens, art and industrial museums, and similar
institutions where his child can obtain entertainment,
some insight into the workings of natural laws, and
elementary instruction in subjects which will inevitably
form part of his school curriculum at a later
day.</p>

<p>But, it may be objected, does not all this mean
that in order to make sure of results the father and
mother will have to give the greater part of their
time to the child’s education? Not at all. One
hour or so a day will be quite enough in the way of
direct, personal tuition. And even if the task of instruction
were really burdensome, surely, in view of
the findings of modern science, parents will do
well to keep in mind, and recognize the profound
truth of, Rousseau’s stern pronouncement:</p>

<p>“He who cannot fulfil the duties of a father has
no right to be a father. Not poverty, nor severe
labour, nor human respect can release him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
duty of supporting his children and of educating
them himself. Readers, you may believe my words.
I prophesy to any one who has natural feeling and
neglects these sacred duties—that he will long shed
bitter tears over this fault, and that for these tears
he will find no consolation.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
